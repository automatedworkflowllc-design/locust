// One debugging port per smoke, and no two the same.
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-11, and it is the root of most of the suite's flaky tail.
// Eleven port numbers were used by two smokes each, and the sweep runs them in
// alphabetical order, so several collided at close range:
//
//   schedule / steering      both 9299, TWO apart in run order
//   raw-conversation / relay both 9233, ONE apart
//   avatar / cursor          both 9227, TWO apart
//
// Those are four of the exact smokes `docs/FINDING-smoke-sweep-2026-09-11.md`
// recorded as flaky -- "roughly four of thirty-two are red on any given run,
// and it is not the same four."
//
// The sweep is sequential, so in principle nothing overlaps. In practice each
// smoke launches an ELECTRON app as its own child and the sweep waits only for
// the node process that spawned it. An app that is still shutting down still
// holds its debugging port, so the next smoke either cannot bind -- or, far
// worse, attaches its CDP client to the PREVIOUS app and drives a window that
// is on the wrong screen and about to disappear. That produces exactly the
// reported symptoms: "no row", "no composer", a screen nobody navigated to,
// none of it reproducible alone.
//
// Every app-launching smoke takes its port from here. A number appearing twice
// is a failure of this file, so `assertPortsAreUnique` exists and the sweep
// calls it before running anything.

/**
 * The port each smoke drives its app on.
 *
 * Explicit rather than derived from a directory listing: a person reading a
 * smoke should be able to see which port it takes without running anything,
 * and adding a smoke should not silently move everybody else's.
 *
 * The `_tools` drives use 9490-9599 and must stay out of this range.
