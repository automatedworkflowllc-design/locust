/**
 * Versions this reader accepts, each a strict subset of the next, so all are
 * read rather than rejected: bumping the number without this list would make
 * every mission recorded before the bump come back as `unsupported-schema`,
 * which reads to a user as their history disappearing. A file's version is
 * fixed by its header and every record in it must match, so appends to an
 * older mission stay at that mission's version.
 *
 * v1 -> v2 widened `runtime` and `model`. v2 -> v3 widened `sandbox` from the
 * literal 'read-only' to include 'workspace-write': a v2 reader must not be
 * handed a mission that was allowed to write, because it would render the
 * run's permissions as read-only and be wrong about what happened.
 *
 * v3 -> v4 adds `continuesFrom`. A handoff to a different runtime cannot be the
 * same mission: a mission records ONE runtime, and every event must agree with
 * it. So a handoff is a NEW mission that continues from a checkpoint of the
 * previous one -- which is also the truthful record, since two runs really did
 * happen. An older reader shown a v4 file would drop that link and present the
 * continuation as an unrelated mission.
 *
 * v4 -> v5 adds `mission.peer` records: a mission's cross-references into the
 * workroom, by message id, for the messages it was shown at its start and the
 * ones its work posted. The text lives in the workroom's own file, never here.
 * A v4 reader stops at the first record it cannot name, so a v5 file handed to
 * one would lose every record after the first peer link.
 *
 * v5 -> v6 widens `continuesFrom.reason` to include `follow-up`: a second turn
 * in the same conversation. It is a NEW mission for the same reason a route
 * switch is -- one mission holds one run, and a second turn is a second
 * process -- but it is not a handoff, and a reader that assumed every
 * continuation was a route switch would draw a handoff divider across an
 * ordinary reply.
 *
 * v6 -> v7 widens `runtime` again, to Cursor Agent and Gemini CLI. A v6 reader
 * handed a Gemini mission would refuse its header as invalid and report the
 * whole mission unreadable, so the number moves for the same reason it moved
 * from 1 to 2.
 *
 * v9 -> v10 adds `startedBy`. Until now every mission in the file looked like
 * something a person asked for, because every mission WAS. The relay broke
 * that: when one teammate writes to another, the host starts the recipient's
 * run by itself, with a prompt the host wrote. Nothing on the record said so,
 * so the app could only present that run as a mission the person began -- a
 * new conversation in their list, titled with machine instructions. Colin, on
 * 2026-09-04: *"this pops up as its own mission, 'missions' are like projects
 * or whole new conversations."*
 *
 * It is deliberately about WHO STARTED THE RUN rather than about the relay, so
 * a later host-started run has somewhere truthful to say so. An older reader
 * would drop the field and be wrong in exactly the way the app was.
 *
 * v11 -> v12 adds `command`: the executable and arguments the host actually
 * ran, with the prompt replaced by a marker. Everything else in this file
 * describes what a runtime SAID; this is the one record of what it was ASKED,
 * and its absence cost eight experiments on 2026-09-05 reconstructing a
 * command by reading the builder and hoping the reconstruction matched. For a
 * beta it matters more: a tester's machine cannot be borrowed, and a failure
 * report without the argv is a question nobody can answer remotely.
 *
 * v10 -> v11 takes that extension point up: `startedBy.kind` gains `resume`, a
 * run the host started to pick a mission back up from its last checkpoint
 * after the app stopped mid-work. Same reason as v10 -- its prompt is a
 * briefing the host wrote, so nothing may show it as a mission title -- and a
 * v10 reader would refuse the record outright, since `relay` was the only kind
 * it knew.
 *
 * v12 -> v13: `startedBy.kind` gains `routine`, a run the host started to
 * replay one step of a routine a person saved from an earlier conversation
 * (`routineId`, and which `step` this run is). Same rule as relay and resume:
 * the ledger says a person did not ask for this run, and a v12 reader would
 * refuse a starter it does not know rather than mislabel it.
 *
 * v14 -> v15 adds `mode`. The record has always said what a run was ALLOWED
 * (`sandbox`) and never what was ASKED FOR, and those are not the same
 * question: `ask` and `plan` are both read-only, so a plan reopened after a
 * restart came back as an ordinary read-only run -- its "Build this plan"
 * offer gone, and in its place a sentence about the change being only in the
 * reply, which is the wrong thing to say about a plan (QA, 2026-09-06). A
 * v14 reader shown a v15 file would drop the mode and be wrong in exactly
 * that way, quietly, so the number moves.
 *
 * v13 -> v14 widens `sandbox` again, to `full-access`: the Auto mode a person
 * switches on for themselves, in which a run is not confined to the workspace
 * folder. Exactly the reason the number moved from 2 to 3, one step further --
 * a v13 reader handed such a mission would refuse its header and report the
 * whole mission unreadable, and the alternative (letting it through under an
 * older number) would be worse, because that reader would draw a run that
 * could touch the whole machine as one confined to a folder. The permission a
 * run had is the last thing a record may be vague about.
 *
 * v16 -> v17 adds `mission.edit_check` records: what the person's own check
 * command said after a turn that changed files (A3.3). The host runs it after
 * the turn has ended, so it cannot be a runtime event -- nothing a runtime
 * said -- and without a record a reopened conversation lost the card and its
 * Send button. A v16 reader stops at the first record it cannot name, so the
 * number moves for the reason it moved at v5.
 *
 * v17 -> v18: `startedBy.kind` gains `terminal`, a turn the person had with
 * the runtime in its own terminal, on this conversation's session, brought
 * back into the record (docs/PLAN-TERMINAL-CATCH-UP-2026-09-27.md;
 * `exchange` counts them from 1). Locust did not run it -- no command, no
 * mode it chose -- and a v17 reader would refuse a starter it does not know
 * rather than draw it as a run Locust made, so the number moves for the
 * reason it moved at v11 and v13.
 *
 * v18 -> v19: `startedBy.kind` gains `side`, a question asked ON THE SIDE of
 * a conversation (docs/PLAN-2026-09-29-FOLDERS-LIKE-CLAUDE-CODE.md, Devin's
 * side chats): a read-only run on a FORK of that conversation's session, which
 * the conversation never sees. `of` names the conversation's turn it forked
 * from, `question` counts them from 1. A v18 reader would draw it as a turn of
 * no conversation, so the number moves for the reason it moved at v18.
 *
 * v19 -> v20 adds `mission.approval` records: a card the person answered, and
 * how (0.576). Saving a conversation's record (0.575) found the ledger held
 * no approval at all -- only a declined call's own words, and nothing of one
 * that was allowed -- so the record a person is told they get could not show
 * what they let a teammate do. The host answers the card, not the runtime, so
 * it cannot be a runtime event, and a v19 reader stops at a record it cannot
 * name: the number moves for the reason it moved at v5 and v17.
 *
 * v20 -> v21 adds a fourth answerer, `earlier-always` (0.616): a request the
 * person's own Always, pressed on an earlier card of the run, allowed with no
 * card (the PRD's R8, one decision path). Each host used to answer those
 * itself and the ledger held nothing of them. A v20 reader stops at an
 * approval whose answerer it does not know, and drops the rest of the turn
 * with it, so the number moves; a v20 mission cannot take one.
 *
 * v21 -> v22 adds `parentItemId` to a tool event: the call was made by a
 * helper the teammate sent out, not by the teammate (helper visibility,
 * 2026-10-05). A v21 reader keeps a tool event with a field it does not know,
 * so it would not stop -- it would draw every Read and Grep the helper made
 * as the teammate's own, and count them in the teammate's work. The number
 * moves so that reader refuses the file rather than misstate it. The field
 * is optional, so every older ledger reads as it did, with no child rows.

   * MEASURED 2026-09-17: eighteen of Colin's missions went in four seconds

   * Bin entry, no shadow copy, nothing to undo. A day of work was recovered

   *
   * So the file is RENAMED rather than removed. A rename inside one directory
   * is atomic and copies no bytes, so this costs nothing on a large ledger,
   * and the record is byte-identical if it comes back.
   *
   * The mtime is restamped to now, deliberately: that is what `listTrashed`
   * reports as the moment it was deleted, and it means the trash needs no
   * index of its own to keep in step with the files in it. Nothing reads a
   * trashed mission's last-updated time -- `storageReport` only looks at
   * files in the root -- so no information anyone uses is lost.
