/**
 * ANYTHING A PERSON CAN PICK MUST BE SOMETHING THE LEDGER CAN WRITE DOWN.
 *
 * Colin, on 0.247.0, first run on the new runtime:
 *
 *   Stopped -- the mission ledger could not be written
 *   The mission could not be created in the durable local ledger. Locust
 *   stopped the run rather than continue without a durable record.
 *
 * Muse Code had been added to `MissionRuntimeId`, to the display names, to
 * the capability table, to discovery and to the command builder. It had a
 * measured event normalizer and a packaged build that offered it in the
 * picker. What it did not have was a line in the ledger's own
 * `MISSION_RUNTIMES`, which was `readonly string[]` and therefore tied to
 * nothing the compiler checks -- so every Muse mission was refused at the
 * last gate before launch, by the one component that must never be the
 * reason a run does not happen.
 *
 * The list is a `satisfies Record<MissionRuntimeId, true>` now, so the next
 * runtime is a compile error. This is the other half: the same claim proved
 * against real files on disk, because a type says what a value should be and
 * a file says what happened.
