/**
 * Discovery reports as it happens, one probe at a time.
 *
 * **`probe.started` fires before the subprocess is spawned.** The whole
 * value of the boot screen is the gap between issuing a command and its
 * answer. If both events arrive together there is nothing to show during the
 * wait, and the screen can only say "checking…" and then jump — which is
 * exactly what it did before this.
 *
 * **Probes START one at a time, in order.** Raced, every row appears at once,
 * every elapsed counter ticks together, and a log meant to be read is noise.
 *
 * They are no longer strictly SEQUENTIAL, and the reason is measured. The
 * handoff asked for sequential on the stated assumption that "the total cost
 * is a few hundred ms". On Colin's own machine, where the runtimes are
 * actually installed, `cursor-agent` ran past six seconds — and strictly
 * sequential makes the total the SUM, so the slowest runtime became
 * everybody else's wait on every launch. He felt it immediately: *"maybe its
 * taking so long because its not realizing the runtimes are connected?"*
 *
 * The stagger keeps what sequential was FOR (rows arriving one at a time, in
 * order) and drops what it cost (the sum).
