/**
 * Antigravity transcript lines -> product events. EXPERIMENTAL.
 *
 * Google's Antigravity IDE has no streaming CLI. Its `language_server.exe`
 * takes `agentapi new-conversation` / `send-message`, and everything the agent
 * then does appears in a file: one JSON object per line, appended as each step
 * completes, at
 * `~/.gemini/antigravity/brain/<conversationId>/.system_generated/logs/transcript.jsonl`.
 * The host tails that file and feeds this normalizer one line at a time; there
 * is no process whose stdout these arrive on, which is why `accept` is built to
 * survive being handed the same line again (see `seen`).
 *
 * Every shape below was measured on 2026-09-03 against TWO conversations, kept
 * verbatim in `test/fixtures/antigravity/`: a prompt answered in one word, and
 * a prompt that wrote a file and was then continued with `send-message`. Two
 * conversations is a thin basis, and the places that matter are called out.
 *
 * What was measured, and what it means here:
 *
 * - Each line carries `step_index`, `source`, `type`, `status` and `created_at`,
 *   then EITHER `content` (a string) OR `thinking` plus `tool_calls`.
 * - `USER_INPUT` (source `USER_EXPLICIT`) is the prompt the host already sent.
 *   `CHECKPOINT` (source `SYSTEM`) is Antigravity's own running summary of the
 *   conversation -- in the captures it names the objective, the user's requests
 *   and the path of the full log, and on a long conversation it would hold far
 *   more. Neither produces an event, and neither is ever copied into evidence:
 *   the checkpoint is the whole conversation in one field, and the ledger is
 *   not where it belongs.
 * - `PLANNER_RESPONSE` (source `MODEL`) is the model's turn. With `thinking` it
 *   is reasoning, and the reasoning TEXT never reaches the ledger -- the record
 *   is rebuilt without the field before evidence is taken, exactly as Cursor's
 *   thinking deltas and Codex's reasoning items are handled.
 * - `GENERIC` (source `MODEL`) carries a tool's result text. It does not name
 *   the tool it belongs to; its STEP does -- a planner line at step p with n
 *   calls is answered at p+1 .. p+n, in call order (measured 2026-09-25, see
 *   `awaiting`). A result no call claims gets a diagnostic rather than a tool
 *   call invented to hang it on.
 * - A `PLANNER_RESPONSE` with `content` and no `tool_calls` is the final answer,
 *   whether or not it also carries `thinking` -- a model that reasons and
 *   answers in one step is still answering (measured 2026-09-06; requiring no
 *   reasoning here is what left a live run's stop button on screen).
 *   That it also means the turn is OVER is a HEURISTIC: it held in both captured
 *   conversations and there is no terminal record of any kind in the file, so
 *   nothing better was available. It is exposed as `latestFinal` rather than
 *   acted on here, because the host is the one polling and only the host can
 *   decide it has waited long enough.
 * - `send-message` does NOT append a `USER_INPUT` line. Measured: the message
 *   arrives as source `SYSTEM`, type `SYSTEM_MESSAGE`, wrapped in a
 *   `<SYSTEM_MESSAGE>` envelope that tells the model it was "not actually sent
 *   by the user". It is the host's own send coming back, so it produces no
 *   event -- but it is recognised, so a follow-up is never reported as a line
 *   this adapter could not read.
 * - `status` was `DONE` on every line captured. Anything else is treated as a
 *   step still running: nothing is emitted and the index is NOT marked seen, so
 *   the host re-reads the same line once it settles and it is normalized then.
 *
 * Types not seen at all: the file only ever showed the four above. An unknown
 * type is preserved as a diagnostic rather than dropped.
