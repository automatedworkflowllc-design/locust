   * `opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` -- Muse THROUGH OpenCode --
   * and the second route to it is Cursor, who also resell it. Both are
   * arrangements between two other companies. Colin, 2026-09-21: *"we have
   * no control over whether opencode continues to support muse so its
   * better that we integrate it ourself through meta/muse"*.
   *
   * He is right, and the earlier assessment that talked him out of it was
   * wrong twice. It said "customers already have Muse twice" -- availability
   * TODAY, which is the exact reasoning `freeStartStillFree` exists to
   * reject -- and it rested on a blocker that has since lifted: native
   * Windows landed in Muse Code 1.3.0 (2026-09), and that document's own
   * revisit condition was "if native Windows support lands".
   *
   * What it does NOT hedge is the free tier. Muse's own CLI is a paid
   * subscription, so this is a bring-your-own-account runtime like Codex,
   * Claude, Cursor and Copilot. The free promise still rests on OpenCode
   * publishing something with a `-free` suffix, which is checked separately
   * and on its own evidence.

   * a request/response protocol, and the prompt travels inside a request.
   * The ordinary process runner refuses that spec rather than guessing, so a
   * protocol command can only be run by something that speaks the protocol.
   *
   * `prompt-file` means the runner writes the prompt to a temporary file and
   * substitutes its path for `PROMPT_FILE_PLACEHOLDER` in `args`. Muse Code

   *

   *     with `usage: muse exec [OPTIONS] [PROMPT]`. It does not read stdin.
   *   - It is reached through `muse.cmd`, so `cmd.exe` caps the command line
   *     at 8,191 characters.

   * Those two together are the failure OpenCode already had and already fixed

   * so the prompt goes in a file instead of argv, and `commandTooLong` --
   * which only limits `stdin: "none"` -- correctly stops applying.
   *
   * `stream-json` is Claude Code's `--input-format stream-json`: the prompt
   * goes as the first user turn and input stays open until the turn's result,
   * so a message can be handed to the running turn (A2.10).
