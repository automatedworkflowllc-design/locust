/**
 * One turn over the Agent Client Protocol, shaped like a process run (0.377;
 * docs/PLAN-ACP-ROUTE-2026-09-26.md).
 *
 * ACP is JSON-RPC over the agent's stdin and stdout, one message a line --
 * the framing `createAppServerClient` already speaks for Codex. The run is
 * `initialize`, then `session/new` (or `session/load` to continue one), then
 * `session/prompt`, whose answer is the turn's end; the work arrives meanwhile
 * as `session/update` notifications, and the agent ASKS before acting with
 * `session/request_permission`. MEASURED on this machine, 2026-09-26, against
 * `copilot --acp` 1.0.88 and `opencode acp` 1.18.27 (test/fixtures/acp/):
 *
 * - Locust offers the agent NOTHING: no file reading or writing, no terminal
 *   (DECISION-2026-09-20). Every request but a permission is refused as a
 *   method this client does not have.
 * - `session/load` REPLAYS the whole conversation as updates before it
 *   answers. So nothing is recorded until the prompt has been sent: the
 *   replay is the past, and taking it for this turn would put the first
 *   turn's words in this one's mouth.
 * - A permission request offers options by id, and the ids differ by agent
 *   (Copilot `allow_once`, OpenCode `once`), so the answer is chosen by the
 *   option's KIND. "Always" is never passed on: whether an agent keeps it
 *   past this run, or in its own settings, is the agent's business and was
 *   not measured -- so Locust remembers it, for this run only. Since 0.616
 *   the main process does (shared/who-decides.ts), after the saved rules:
 *   this run asks about every request, and an Always goes back as "once".
 * - One session can move between Locust's two Copilot routes. A session the
 *   print route created loaded over ACP with its history, and the print route
 *   then resumed the session ACP had used, with the ACP turn in it.
 * - ACP has no way to add to a turn while it runs. What would be added -- a
 *   denial's reason, a message to a busy teammate -- is kept and sent as the
 *   next prompt the moment this one ends (`steer`). Copilot ends its turn on
 *   a refusal (measured), so a reason is read almost at once.
 *
 * The records are the updates, verbatim, and three the run writes itself
 * (see acp-events.ts): the session id, a refusal, a prompt's end.
