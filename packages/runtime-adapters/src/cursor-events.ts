/**
 * Cursor Agent `stream-json` -> product events.
 *
 * Every shape here was measured against cursor-agent 2026.08.31 under the
 * exact argv `createCursorPrintCommand` produces, with the prompt on stdin.
 * The captured streams are the fixtures in `test/fixtures/cursor/`: a
 * read-only run with partial output, a write-mode run whose shell commands
 * were rejected, and a resumed turn.
 *
 * What was measured, and what it means here:
 *
 * - `system`/`init` carries the session id (which `--resume` takes back), the
 *   model Cursor resolved (`"Auto"`, `"Composer 2.5"`), the permission mode,
 *   the cwd and the auth source. It is allow-listed like Claude's.
 * - `thinking` deltas are the model's reasoning. Their text is KEPT -- Colin
 *   overturned the redaction on 2026-09-15, and the long comment at the
 *   `thinking` branch says why -- with secrets scrubbed from it as from
 *   anything else. They become a `reasoning` step so the step line can show
 *   that thinking is happening. (This paragraph said REDACTED for five days
 *   after the code stopped doing it, and a smoke test written from the
 *   paragraph rather than the code reported the app broken every sweep since.
 *   A comment that outlives its code is not a stale comment, it is a false
 *   claim with a test behind it.)
 * - `assistant` records come in two forms that look alike. With
 *   `--stream-partial-output` each fragment arrives as its own record carrying
 *   `timestamp_ms` and no `model_call_id`; then the COMPLETE message arrives
 *   as one more record, either with a `model_call_id` or with no timestamp at
 *   all. The complete one REPLACES the fragments -- appending it would double
 *   every answer. A run can hold several messages (one before a tool call,
 *   one after), so each complete message closes its own item rather than all
 *   of them sharing one.
 * - `tool_call` started/completed wrap one typed key (`readToolCall`,
 *   `editToolCall`, `shellToolCall`, `globToolCall`, ...) with `args` and, on
 *   completion, a `result` whose WRAPPER KEY is the outcome: `success` or
 *   `rejected` in the captures. In print mode without `--force`, every shell
 *   command was `rejected`: a tool that did not run, so it is `tool.failed`,
 *   never completed. Any other wrapper key is also a failure -- an outcome
 *   this build has never seen must not be recorded as if it went well.
 * - `success` means the tool was ALLOWED TO RUN, not that it worked. A shell
 *   result carries the command's own `exitCode` inside that wrapper, so a
 *   command that ran and exited non-zero is a failure with its code recorded,
 *   the way the Codex adapter reads `exit_code`.
 * - A rejected call's completion carries no `args`; the command it wanted to
 *   run is inside `result.rejected.command`. Reading only `args` dropped the
 *   one fact a rejection exists to record.
 *   One capture's call ids contained a literal newline; item ids are made
 *   single-line without losing either half.
 * - `result` closes the run: `is_error` and a non-success subtype mean a
 *   failure, and its absence on a clean exit is not a success.

       * EVENING, 2026-09-11, same CLI:
       *
       *   f8dedec3  complete message keys: type,message,session_id,model_call_id,timestamp_ms
       *   fd0adba1  complete message keys: type,message,session_id,timestamp_ms
       *
       * In the second, nothing distinguishes the complete message from a
       * fragment -- so it was appended, and the reply said itself twice:
       * "...to Yurt for his take.Looking up NVIDIA forward earnings now,
       * then I'll hand the numbers to Yurt for his take." (Colin's
       * screenshot, and 2872 characters of it in the ledger.)
       *
       * The doubling was the visible half. The worse half is that the item
       * was never CLOSED: nothing was ever marked final, and everything the
       * host reads out of a reply reads the last FINAL message -- the share,
       * the memory block, the room task, the workroom post. So a teammate
       * who had plainly written something was reported as "Jimothy's turn
       * ended without a reply", which is what Colin saw next.
       *
       * So the content decides when the field does not. A complete message
       * RESTATES exactly what its fragments already delivered; a fragment
       * adds to it. That is a fact about what the stream contains rather
       * than about which keys this version chose to send.
       *
       * TWO GUARDS, and the second was earned by this repo's own test.
       *
       * A message of 20,000 identical characters arrives as two fragments of
       * 10,000 identical characters -- so the SECOND fragment equals
       * everything delivered so far, and a naive content rule closed the
       * message at half its length. That test was written for a different
       * defect and caught this one, which is the whole reason to run the
       * suite before believing a rule.
       *
       * So a restatement must cover SEVERAL fragments, not one. Cursor
       * streams token by token, so the complete message always restates many
       * of them; a single fragment that happens to equal everything before it
       * is one fragment repeating one fragment, which is text.
       *
       * `text.length > 1` keeps the other honestly ambiguous case: a single
       * character repeated ("a" then "a") is a real two-character message.
