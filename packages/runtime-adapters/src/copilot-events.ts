/**
 * GitHub Copilot CLI `--output-format json` -> product events.
 *
 * Every shape here was measured against GitHub Copilot CLI 1.0.82 on
 * 2026-09-03, under the argv `createCopilotPromptCommand` produces. The
 * captured streams are the fixtures in `test/fixtures/copilot/`: a plain
 * reply, an `apply_patch` that created a file, a read-only run where both the
 * patch and the shell were refused, a session set and then resumed, and a run
 * an organisation policy refused outright.
 *
 * What was measured, and what it means here:
 *
 * - The stream is far chattier than the ledger needs. Roughly half the record
 *   types are the CLI narrating its own model plumbing (`model.turn_started`,
 *   `model.model_call_started`, `model.response`, `model.tool_execution`,
 *   `model.messages_snapshot`, ...). They are DROPPED, not summarized: they
 *   duplicate the `assistant.*` and `tool.*` records that carry the same facts
 *   in a smaller shape, and one of them carries the entire system prompt.
 * - `model.messages_snapshot` holds the CLI's whole system prompt and the
 *   conversation verbatim. It never reaches the ledger under any code path.
 *   Neither do `session.skills_loaded` (the operator's own local skills, their
 *   descriptions and their paths) or `user.message` (the prompt, which the
 *   ledger already holds).
 * - Several records carry opaque provider blobs -- `reasoningOpaque`,
 *   `encryptedContent`, `apiCallId`, `reasoningId`. They are the model's
 *   reasoning in a form nothing here can read, and they are stripped for the
 *   same reason Cursor's thinking text is: an unreadable secret in the ledger
 *   is still a secret in the ledger.
 * - `assistant.message_delta` streams the answer; `assistant.message` then
 *   arrives with the whole thing. The complete message REPLACES the fragments
 *   under the same item id, which the stream supplies as `messageId` -- so two
 *   answers in one run stay two answers.
 * - `tool.execution_complete` reports `success` as a plain boolean, and a
 *   refusal arrives as `success: false` with `error.code` `denied`. A missing
 *   `success` is a failure: this build has never seen the field absent, and a
 *   tool whose outcome is unknown is not a tool that worked.
 * - `apply_patch` returns a real `diff --git` in `result.detailedContent`, so
 *   the change itself is recorded rather than a claim that a file was touched.
 * - The session id IS in the stream, in the terminal `result` record -- which
 *   the brief for this work did not expect. It is used when it arrives and the
 *   host's own `--session-id` stands in until then, so a run that dies before
 *   the last line still leaves something a follow-up can resume from.
