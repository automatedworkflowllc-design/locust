// Colin asked for images in chat. The model half already worked -- measured,
// Claude Code, Cursor and Copilot all open a screenshot they are pointed at
// (docs/ATTACHMENTS-MEASURED-2026-09-08.md) -- so what was missing was the
// person's half: attaching a screenshot and seeing the word `shot.png`, with
// no way to tell WHICH screenshot without leaving the app.
//
// This attaches a real PNG from outside the workspace (so the copy-in path
// runs too) and checks that a thumbnail is actually painted, at a real size,
// in both the composer and the thread. Nothing is sent, so nothing is spent.
