// A drive is not a smoke: nothing here asserts. It launches the BUILT app
// on a throwaway profile, does what a person does, and keeps what the
// screen showed at each step -- the text, a screenshot, and the renderer's
// error count -- under docs/user-session/<stamp>-<name>/. The judging is
// done afterwards by reading the record (Colin, 2026-09-05: "start taking
// screenshots when you drive the app and test so you can get a user
// experience"), so a hitch is a thing that was seen, not a thing the script
// was told to look for.
//
// Every drive picks its own debugging port and refuses to start when that
// port already answers: two drives on one port both bind it, and the second
// silently drives the first app.

// FIRST, for its side effect: it points tmpdir() outside AppData, which is
// where `~/.cursorignore` makes every Cursor run blind. See the file.
