// Eyes and hands on the clean-Windows beta VM, without Guest Additions.
//
//   node _tools/beta-vm.mjs state
//   node _tools/beta-vm.mjs look <name>          screenshot, kept with the others
//   node _tools/beta-vm.mjs type "some text"     typed into the guest
//   node _tools/beta-vm.mjs press enter|win|tab|esc|down|up
//   node _tools/beta-vm.mjs run "<powershell>"   Win+R, type, Enter
//   node _tools/beta-vm.mjs forward              guest 9222 -> host 9222
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN `clean-machine.mjs`. That tool drove a VM built
// with Guest Additions, so it could copy a file in and start a process. This
// VM was built without them on purpose (the handoff of 2026-09-20), and
// installing them is itself something you would have to do from inside the
// guest -- which is the thing you cannot do. The way out is that VirtualBox
// will type for you: `keyboardputstring` and `keyboardputscancode` go to the
// guest's keyboard whether anything is installed in it or not.
//
// AND IT IS THE BETTER TEST ANYWAY. Copying the installer in over a shared
// folder skips the first two things a real user meets: the download, and
// what Windows says about running it. The guest has NAT, so it fetches the
// published installer from the internet like anybody else.
//
// THE ONE RULE: never power-cycle this VM while Windows is installing. Two
// earlier machines were lost that way -- setup leaves no bootable disk until
// it finishes, so the next boot either finds nothing or re-runs setup from
// the ISO. There is no resume, only starting again.
