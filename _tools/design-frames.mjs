// Twelve frames for the design review, at real window sizes.
//
//   node _tools/design-frames.mjs
//
// Asked for on 2026-09-14: the whole window including chrome, PNG, no
// cropping and no scaling, at 1120x720 (the minimum, where things break),
// 1477 (the default) and maximised. Display scaling here is 100% on a
// 1920x1080 screen, so a pixel in these files is a pixel.
//
// The window is moved by Win32 -- a real OS resize, NOT by
// `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`, which changes the PAGE and leaves the
// OS window where it was -- what Astra rightly called "narrower evidence, not
// a native-window sizing pass". Every frame reports the size Windows ACTUALLY
// gave the window, because a request is not a measurement and a minimum size
// refuses silently.
//
// CAPTURE is CDP, not PrintWindow, and that was measured rather than assumed.
// PrintWindow draws the composited swarm-mark image at the wrong offset: in a
// 1477 frame it landed in the middle of the `effort - fixed` label and looked
// exactly like a layout collision. The DOM says otherwise -- the label ends
// at x=1198 and the mark starts at x=1215, a 17px gap -- and a CDP capture of
// the same state shows them cleanly apart. A frame that invents a defect is
// worse than no frame, so the window is sized natively and photographed by
// the renderer. The cost is the 8px Windows border, which carries no design.
//
// Free OpenCode only. Nothing here spends, so anything needing an approval
// is skipped and said so rather than substituted.
