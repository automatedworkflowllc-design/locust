//
// WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE, because the first version of it claimed
// more than it showed. It launches with a bare PATH, which was meant to
// simulate a machine with no runtimes installed. It does not: discovery
// deliberately looks in known install locations after PATH, so it found four
// runtimes anyway -- correctly, and by design.
//
// So this is a check that **a machine where the CLIs were never added to PATH
// still works**, which is a real and common case and worth guarding. A true
// clean-machine first run cannot be simulated from a developer box that has
// the CLIs installed at all, and pretending otherwise would be the exact
// green-check-that-cannot-go-red this repo keeps finding. That case needs a
// machine, and it is the single biggest unknown before a beta.

// The PATH a person has when they never added the CLI folders themselves:
// Windows, and whatever interpreters their installers put there. Node stays,
// and that is the whole correction -- the first version of this stripped it
// too, npm's `copilot.cmd` shim calls `node`, and the probe failed with
// `'"node"' is not recognized`. I nearly reported that as a Copilot bug. It
// reproduces only on a PATH no real user has: a machine that npm-installed
// the CLI necessarily has node on PATH, and with the real environment the
// same probe returns "GitHub Copilot CLI 1.0.82." and exit 0.
//
// So this removes the RUNTIME directories and nothing else, which is the case
// worth guarding: discovery must find a CLI its installer never put on PATH.
