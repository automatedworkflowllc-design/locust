# Exit codes -- commit on 0 and on nothing else:
#    0   every check passed ("GATE PASSED")
#   75   refused to start: the machine was not quiet (under 2 GB of free
#        virtual memory, or another vitest running anywhere on it). Nothing
#        was run, so nothing is red; run it again when the other work is done.
#    1   something failed (a type check keeps tsc's own non-zero code)
#
# A red gate says why (2026-10-05). It used to keep `grep "×|FAIL"`: the name
# of each failed test and not the line under it, so a timeout and an assertion
# looked the same and the reason was gone. Now every failed test is a `GATE:`
# line with the reason vitest gave, vitest's own failure section follows, and
# the suites' full logs are kept in the folder the last line names.
#
# One retry, of one kind. If the desktop suite fails and EVERY failed test
# failed by timing out, only those files are run once more, and the gate prints
# that it did and which. An assertion failure, a file that would not load, an
# unhandled error, or anything the log cannot account for is never retried.
# The log is read by _tools/gate-support.mjs, which also makes the quiet-machine
# check (what it found is printed, as `GATE quiet:` lines, at the top).
# _tools/gate-selftest.sh runs this script against a pretend npx and checks each
# way it can end (green, retried, refused, red); run it after changing this file.
