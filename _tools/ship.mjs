// gate and nobody noticed. `pnpm typecheck` runs two configs -- node and web
// -- and I had been running one of them plus a third that is not the gate at
// all. Eight errors sat there through 0.38.7, 0.38.8 and 0.38.9, six of them
// dead props left by my own change and two in a test file I wrote.
//
// And because "I verified it" twice meant reading `out/`, which is not what
// anybody installs. The installer carries `app.asar`; that is the artefact,
// and it is what this checks.
//
// The markers are the honest part. A changelog bullet claims something is in
// the app; passing that claim's own words here proves the built artefact
// contains them. Read as UTF-8 -- a latin1 read reported a present string as
// missing twice tonight, because an em-dash is three bytes.

// 2b. An installer is built from the WORKING TREE, not from a commit.
//
//     On 2026-09-08 two agents were editing this checkout at once, and for
//     about forty-five minutes any release would have packaged the other's
//     half-finished feature -- typechecking, passing its own tests, and
//     completely unintended. The gates above cannot catch that: uncommitted
//     work can be perfectly green and still be nobody's idea of a release.
//
//     So a release is cut from a tree with nothing outstanding in it. That is
//     also what makes `git log` an honest record of what any given installer
//     contains, which it silently was not before.
//
//     Untracked files under `docs/user-session/` are the one exception: drives
//     write their records there constantly, they ship nothing, and requiring a
//     commit for every screenshot would make this gate something to route
//     around rather than obey.

//     WHAT COUNTS AS OUTSTANDING IS NOW WHAT CAN REACH THE INSTALLER.
//
//     `electron-builder.yml` packages `out/**`, `package.json` and
//     `resources/**` and nothing else, so a drive script or a design note
//     cannot be "built into this installer" however dirty it is. The gate
//     said it could, which made it say something false -- and on 2026-09-21,
//     with a second agent mid-task in this tree on the drive tools, that
//     false claim blocked a release fixing a bug the user had reported twice
//     in ten minutes.
//
//     The pressure then is to force it, or to commit the other agent's
//     half-finished work under your own message. Both are worse than the
//     gate. So the rule is narrowed to the paths that actually decide what
//     ships, and EVERY exemption is printed: a gate that quietly forgives
//     things is how the next one gets routed around.
//
//     `_tools/ship.mjs` is deliberately NOT exempt. It is this file, and a
//     half-edited release script decides what a release is.

 * The two steps that come AFTER the release, spelled out here because this is

 *
 * `publish-changelog` is the one that is easy to forget and invisible when
 * forgotten: the app and the site both point at the public CHANGELOG.md, and
 * a release without it leaves both describing the previous build. Uploading
 * the installers one at a time is not fussiness either -- a single
 * `gh release create` carrying both stalled for fifty minutes on 2026-09-17
 * and had to be killed, where one asset per call went through immediately.
 *
 * The block map is what makes an update small: with it, an installed Locust
 * downloads only the blocks that changed (about 2 MB of 117 MB); without it,
 * the whole installer, every time. It went missing from this list for months.
 *
 * A PRERELEASE, THEN ONE A DAY PROMOTED (0.307). The beta handover: testers
 * get at most one new build a day. Every build goes out as a prerelease --
 * taken only by a Locust whose "every build" switch is on -- and
 * promote-release.mjs makes one a day the release GitHub calls latest, which
 * the tester lane and the site both read.
 *
 * DRAFT FIRST (0.304). An installed Locust reads latest.yml from the newest
 * PUBLISHED release. Published with only latest.yml on it, the release sends
 * every Locust that checks in that minute after an installer that is not
 * there yet, or one without its block map -- a full download. A draft is
 * invisible to the channel until every file is on it.
 */
/*
 * ONE COMMAND TO PUBLISH, AND IT CHECKS (2026-09-24). The steps below used
 * to be typed as a chain of gh calls, each piped to `tail`, and a stalled
 * installer upload that was stopped let the chain publish 0.325.0 with no
 * installer: every checking Locust got a 404. publish-release.mjs uploads one
 * file per call with its own exit code, reads the draft back, and publishes
 * only when every file is on it whole -- then checks the installer answers.
