// Page 1 of "Locust UI Review 2026-09-06.dc.html" draws the composer twice:
//
//   SHIPPED   Ask | ridgeline | + | (ring) | Codex CLI / gpt-5.6 | effort · fixed | swarm
//   PROPOSED  Ask | ridgeline |     (ring) | Codex CLI / gpt-5.6 · high v
//
// and the picker below it with a Swarm pill in its header, effort chips
// under the ACTIVE row only, and "held at maximum by swarm" when swarm is on.
//
// I have said three times that this shipped. Colin has said twice that it
// does not look like it. Neither of us should be arguing from memory, so
// this takes the photographs.
//
// Spends nothing -- it opens the composer and the picker.

// The picker no longer holds effort or swarm -- both moved to the composer
// (`lc-effortpanel*`, `lc-swarm`). This asked for `.lc-picker__effort*`, a
// class nothing renders any more, so "none in the picker" was true because
// the class was dead rather than because the control had moved: an
// unfalsifiable pass. Asking for the LIVE class keeps the same question and
// makes a wrong answer possible again.
