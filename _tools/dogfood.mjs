//   node _tools/dogfood.mjs --keep           leave the worktree for inspection
//
// Every other drive hands the app a scratch repo with two files in it. That
// exercises the plumbing and nothing else: a two-file project has no
// architecture to get lost in, no naming convention to notice, no reason for a
// plan to have more than one step. The long-running behaviour that a person
// actually meets -- a plan that survives ten tool calls, a thread that stays
// readable at turn twenty, a receipt that is still honest after a mission that
// touched nine files -- has never been driven, because nothing has ever given
// the app work big enough to need it.
//
// So: this repo, which is the biggest real codebase on hand and the one whose
// bugs matter most here.
//
// THE WORKTREE IS NOT A CONVENIENCE, IT IS THE WHOLE SAFETY STORY.
//
// A teammate editing the checkout that the running app was built from is a bad
// afternoon: the edit lands, a watcher rebuilds, the app under test changes
// beneath the mission, and the record no longer describes any build that ever
// existed. Worse, several sessions write to the live tree. So the workspace is
// a detached-HEAD `git worktree` under the scratch root, removed at the end
// unless --keep. Nothing here ever names the live checkout as a workspace, and
// the guard below refuses to start if it somehow does.
//
// The mission's own instructions tell the teammate it is being observed and
// that its notes on the app are the point. That is deliberate: the finding is
// usually not "the model got the task wrong" but "the app made the task hard
// to do", and the only witness to the second one is the thing doing the work.
//
// Cost: OpenCode's free model by default, so a long run is free. Pass
// --route to spend real money on purpose.

 * Two rules they all obey. They are READ-HEAVY and write to ONE new file, so a
 * bad run produces a bad document rather than a bad edit spread over the
 * codebase -- and the worktree throws the document away anyway. And none of
 * them asks for a build or a test run: a fresh worktree has no node_modules,
 * `pnpm test` would fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the app, and
