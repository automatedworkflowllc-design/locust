#
#   bash _tools/gate-selftest.sh
#
# Runs _tools/gate.sh in a throwaway copy of its own layout, with a pretend
# `npx` whose type checks always pass and whose vitest answers from a script,
# and checks the exit code and the words for each way a run can end: green; a
# timeout-only failure that goes green on the second go; one that does not; an
# assertion (never retried); a mix (never retried); a red package suite; and a
# machine that is not quiet. Seconds, no real suite. The retry is the one path
# a real gate only reaches after a flake, so it is checked here rather than
# waiting for one.
#
# The last case needs the quiet check to see a vitest process, so it starts a
# decoy; the rest need none running, and say so if one is.
