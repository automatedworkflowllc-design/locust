# The Windows build on GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/windows-build.yml` builds Locust's unsigned Windows
installer on GitHub's `windows-latest` runner, in the public repository
`automatedworkflowllc-design/locust-app`. It exists so that a build nobody's
machine touched can be set beside the one the laptop makes, and so that
signing (SignPath, applied for) has somewhere to happen later
(`docs/PLAN-2026-10-05-TO-MARKET.md`, section 3 change 1, phase 1).

## When it runs

- By hand: `gh workflow run windows-build.yml --repo automatedworkflowllc-design/locust-app -f label=v0.620.0`.
  The label is only shown in the summary; the version comes from
  `apps/desktop/package.json`.
- On a pushed tag `v*`. The tag must be `v` plus that version, or the
  hash step fails: a tag that disagrees with the package would put another
  version's name on the installer.
- Never on an ordinary push: the package takes minutes.

## What it does

The workflow sets up checkout, pnpm (from `packageManager`) and Node 24 with
pnpm's store cached, then runs five steps, each one
`bash _tools/ci-windows-local.sh <step>`:

| Step | What |
|---|---|
| install | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` |
| typecheck | builds `packages/runtime-adapters` and `packages/mission-store` (their types feed the desktop's), then `tsc --noEmit` on `apps/desktop`'s node and web configs |
| suites | `npx vitest run` in each folder of `_tools/ci-windows-suites.txt` |
| package | `vendor-npm.mjs`, `vendor-recall.mjs`, `pnpm build`, then `electron-builder --config electron-builder.yml --win --publish never` with `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false` |
| hash | checks the installer, its blockmap, `latest.yml` (saying this version) and `app.asar` exist; prints version, commit, size, SHA-256 of the installer and of `app.asar`; writes them to the job summary |

Then `Locust-<version>-setup.exe`, `Locust-<version>-setup.exe.blockmap` and
`latest.yml` are kept as the run's artifact, `Locust-<version>-windows-<run id>`,
for 14 days. Nothing is published, nothing goes to `locust-releases`, no
secret is read, and the token is read-only.

## What it proves

- The commit installs from its lockfile on a clean Windows machine.
- Both desktop typechecks pass there.
- The adapter and mission-store suites pass there.
- The installer can be made there without anything on the laptop: the npm
  it ships and the recall model are fetched and hash-checked by the vendor
  scripts, as on the laptop.

## What it does not prove

- **Unsigned.** Windows SmartScreen says "unknown publisher", as it does for
  the laptop's builds. Signing comes with SignPath.
- **The desktop suite does not run.** `apps/desktop`'s vitest suite drives a
  window (`runtime-setup.test.ts`) and runs the memory-recall model
  (`memory-recall.test.ts`). It still runs only in `_tools/gate.sh` on the
  laptop, and so do the mutation sweeps and the drives in `_tools/drive-*.mjs`.
- **Not `ship.mjs`.** The release gate's other checks -- version not yet
  released, a clean tree, a changelog entry, what is inside `app.asar` -- are
  not repeated. This is a build to compare, not a release.
- **Not byte-identical to the laptop.** An NSIS installer carries its own build
  time, so the two installers of one commit need not hash alike. Compare
  `app.asar`'s hash (printed beside the installer's) and the size; if
  `app.asar` differs, that is worth finding out why.

## The one difference from `ship.mjs`

`ship.mjs` packages with `pnpm --filter @teammate/desktop package`. Its
electron-builder runs with the default publish policy, and on a runner building
a tag (`GITHUB_REF_TYPE=tag`, which a workflow cannot override) that policy is
"onTag": the builder would try to upload to `locust-releases`. So the package
step calls electron-builder itself with `--publish never`. The package
script's other two parts are left out because neither changes what is
packaged: a second `electron-vite build` (`pnpm build` has just made `out/`)
and the prune of old installers in `release/`.

## Rehearsing it on the laptop

The steps live in `_tools/ci-windows-local.sh`, and the workflow calls that
script rather than repeating its commands, so the rehearsal and the run cannot
drift apart. From the repository root:

    bash _tools/ci-windows-local.sh

runs install, typecheck, suites, package and hash in order, prints the time
each took and ends `CI-WINDOWS LOCAL PASSED` with the installer's hash. On the
laptop the suites step first makes the gate's quiet-machine check and exits 75
(wait and retry, not red) while another vitest is running.

What the rehearsal cannot exercise is what the workflow file itself adds:
`actions/checkout`, `pnpm/action-setup` reading `packageManager`,
`actions/setup-node`'s pnpm cache, the `GITHUB_OUTPUT` and
`GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` writes being read back, the tag check (it needs
`GITHUB_REF_TYPE=tag`), and `actions/upload-artifact`. The first run on the
mirror is their test.

To add a suite, add its folder to `_tools/ci-windows-suites.txt`; both read it.

## Getting the file to the mirror

`_tools/publish-mirror.mjs` keeps the mirror's own `.github/workflows/` and the
export leaves this repository's out, so the file never travels on its own. The
main agent (never an executor) copies it by hand into the mirror's checkout:

1. Copy `.github/workflows/windows-build.yml` into the mirror's
   `.github/workflows/`, beside `ci.yml` and `mutation-nightly.yml`.
2. The workflow needs `_tools/ci-windows-local.sh` and
   `_tools/ci-windows-suites.txt`, which the export carries like the rest of
   `_tools/`, and points at this document, which is on the export's
   `DOCS_PUBLISHED` list. Push the mirror's source (publish-mirror.mjs) from a
   commit that has them before the workflow, or its first run fails at install.
3. Commit and push the mirror, then run it once by hand with a label and
   compare the summary's hashes with the laptop's build of the same commit.
