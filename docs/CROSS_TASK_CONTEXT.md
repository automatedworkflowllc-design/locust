# Cross-task context

How to work on Locust, for a person or an agent session arriving cold.
Updated 2026-10-04, at 0.619. Every rule here names the file that holds it;
when the file and this page disagree, the file is right and this page needs
an edit.

## Read first

1. `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`: the standing rules.
2. `PROJECT.md`: what Locust is and where it stands.
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: how it is built, and what was planned instead.
4. `docs/WHAT-LOCUST-CAN-STOP.md` and `docs/NETWORK.md`: the two documents
   held to the code by tests.
5. `CHANGELOG.md`: what shipped, build by build.
6. The source. The repository is authoritative for what is implemented; a
   document records intent and where things stood when it was written.

In the development repository, the newest `docs/PLAN-*` file and
`docs/PRD-2026-10-04-LOCUST-1.0.md` say what is being worked on. They are not
in the public mirror.

## Where work happens

The repository root, wherever it is checked out. The public copy is a mirror
and has no canonical path; no document names a machine's folder.

**Worktrees.** A session that changes source works in a git worktree of its
own, on a branch of its own (the convention is `exec/<item>`), never in the
checkout a tester is using. Record the branch and the commit it is based on
in the handoff; the main agent reviews and merges. Never assume another
session's uncommitted changes are in your worktree, and never reset, stash
or clean up changes you do not own. Inspect `git status` before editing.

**Who publishes.** One main agent pushes, bumps the version, writes the
changelog entry and publishes. An executor session commits on its branch and
stops: no version bump, no `CHANGELOG.md` edit, no push, no release.

## The gate

```
bash _tools/gate.sh > gate.log 2>&1; echo "gate exit $?"; grep -E "Tests |GATE" gate.log
```

`_tools/gate.sh` runs the type configs and every suite and exits non-zero on
the first failure. Commit on exit 0 and on nothing else. Its own header says
the rest: 75 means it refused to start because the machine was not quiet
(another vitest running, or too little free memory) and nothing was run; a
desktop suite that fails only by timing out is run once more, those files
only, and the gate says so; an assertion failure is never retried; every
failed test is a `GATE:` line with vitest's reason. Scratch files go under
one folder (`LOCUST_GATE_TMP`, by default `.tmp` beside the repository)
because an antivirus scanning thousands of temp folders timed tests out. On
Windows run it from Git Bash; `_tools/gate-selftest.sh` checks the gate
itself after a change to it.

`pnpm check` (build, typecheck, every suite) is the broader run `CONTRIBUTING.md`
asks for. `git diff --check` before a commit.

## Tests

**Named as sentences.** A test file in `apps/desktop/src/main/` is a sentence
that is true of the product: `a-routine-due-while-closed-is-missed.test.ts`,
`the-host-refuses-always-for-a-reaching-command.test.ts`. The sentence is the
claim; the file is the proof. Older files keep module names
(`updates.test.ts`); new ones take a sentence.

**Every test asserts** (`main/tests-assert-something.test.ts` walks every
test body and fails on one with no assertion).

**Controls.** A green suite is not the evidence. Each package has
`test/mutation-control.mjs`, which breaks one behaviour at a time and
requires the NAMED test to fail, rejecting any mutation that stops the file
running; run it from the package folder with `node test/mutation-control.mjs`.
A new derived claim gets a test and a mutation. A smoke carries a negative
control (`_smoke/README.md`); a drive that cannot fail on the build before the
fix is not trusted.

**Documents held by tests.** `docs/WHAT-LOCUST-CAN-STOP.md` is written from
`shared/what-locust-can-stop.ts`; edit the source and regenerate with the
command in the document's first lines. `docs/NETWORK.md` is held by
`main/the-network-is-written-down.test.ts`: a new place in the main process
that reaches the network fails until the document lists it. A saved record
is held to the ledger by the golden file beside
`a-saved-record-says-only-what-the-ledger-holds.test.ts`.

**Source checks.** Sources under `apps/desktop/src` and `packages` are LF
(`sources-are-lf.test.ts`); every CSS class and token used is defined; every
link out is one the host names (`no-dead-links.test.ts`); a failure sentence
says what is still true (`says-what-is-still-true.test.ts`). Read the test
when one of these goes red; each says why it exists.

## Drives, smokes, probes and looks

All under `_tools/` and `_smoke/`, none part of `pnpm check`.

**Drives** (`_tools/drive-*.mjs`, on `_tools/drive-lib.mjs`) launch the built
app on a throwaway profile, do what a person does over CDP, and keep what the
screen showed at each step: text, a screenshot, the renderer's error count.
The judging is done afterwards by reading the record. Each picks its own
debugging port and refuses to start when it is taken. Records go under a
capture folder in `docs/` (`docs/user-session/` by default; `LOCUST_DRIVE_OUT`
moves them elsewhere); the public export
leaves every such folder out by name, and the ship gate's clean-tree check
exempts them, because a capture is evidence about a build and never part of
one. Drives
default to the free OpenCode route (`FREE_ROUTE`; `LOCUST_FREE_MODEL` picks
another free model when it is down); a drive that spends a paid account is
opt-in with `LOCUST_SPEND=1` and refuses otherwise. `--packaged <exe>` runs
one against the installer's build, which is what a release is judged on;
`_tools/sweep-drives.mjs` runs every free packaged drive in turn.

**Smokes** (`_smoke/*-smoke.mjs`) assert, against a real agent or a real
build, and exit non-zero on a failed assertion. `_smoke/README.md` says what
each proves, what it cannot see, and which spend no quota.

**Probes and looks** (`_tools/probe-*.mjs`, `_tools/look-*.mjs`) measure one
thing or render one surface to be looked at. Measure before changing a
hot path; a number from a probe goes in the changelog entry or the plan,
not in a document that will outlive it.

## Shipping

`docs/SHIPPING.md` is the recipe, and `_tools/ship.mjs` is the gate it
describes: typecheck both configs, the unit suite, the version not already on
the releases repository, a changelog entry for it, a clean working tree (only
paths the installer cannot contain are exempt, and each is printed), then
package, then check the installer itself: `app.asar` present, the setup exe
present, `latest.yml` naming the version, every `--marker` string in the
asar, every file beside the asar as staged. `python _tools/bump-version.py
<version> entry.md` moves the version and puts the entry on top of
`CHANGELOG.md`. `_tools/publish-release.mjs` drafts, uploads each file as its
own command, reads the release back, and publishes only when every file is
there; `_tools/promote-release.mjs` marks one build a day as latest for the
tester lane; `_tools/publish-mirror.mjs` brings the public copy up to the
release.

**The changelog** is written for the person using the app, under `### New`,
`### Improved` and `### Fixed`, quoting the words the screen now says. Those
words are the markers. No testers' names.

## The public copy

`_tools/public-export.mjs` builds the mirror from a commit, never from the
working tree. Under `docs/` only the files on its `DOCS_PUBLISHED` list are
published; everything else there (plans, findings, briefs, screenshot
folders, anything named `HANDOFF-*`) stays out, so a new folder of captures
needs no one to remember to exclude it. The export rewrites the owner's
account folder to `<home>` in every text file and refuses to finish if it
remains anywhere; with `--deny <file outside the repository>` it also refuses
if any term from that file (the owner's own details) appears. So in a
published document: no machine paths, no names of people other than public
authors, no account details, no email addresses or phone numbers. The export
is tested by `_tools/public-export.test.mjs`.

## Handoff

Before ending a session that changes the project: re-read the diff and
preserve unrelated work; run the gate; update the document that records what
you changed, if one does; add an entry below if another session must
continue; report exact validation results, and say what was not run.

## Handoff log

Entries since 2026-10-03, newest first. Earlier entries (2026-08-30 to
2026-09-09) are in this file's history in git.

### 2026-10-04 — the docs say what is built (Fable)

- Scope: `exec/docs-truth`, based on `3beebae9` (0.619). Documents only:
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROJECT.md`, `docs/CROSS_TASK_CONTEXT.md`
  rewritten as the built product. No code, version, changelog, push or
  publication.
- Verified by grep on this build: nothing under `apps/`, `packages/` or
  `_tools/` imports `@teammate/contracts` or `@teammate/runtime-core`; the
  only mentions are inside `attic/`. The handoff asked for this check against
  `packages/`; the two had already been moved to `attic/` at 0.589.
- Validation: `_tools/public-export.test.mjs` and `_tools/gate.sh`, results in
  the session's report.
- Recommended next step: review and merge; the PRD's R28 row ("the docs
  describe the built product") can then move.

### 2026-10-03 — W11 Remote Control Settings switch (Casper)

- Scope: `exec/w11-casper`, a fresh worktree based on `origin/main` at
  `edb05f22141f253d461cf4e73681b1fd28af8d7d`. No version or CHANGELOG change,
  packaging, push or publication.
- Built: an off-by-default Settings > AI agents switch; host-owned `claude
  remote-control --spawn worktree --name Locust` in the current project
  folder; boolean-only validated IPC; first stdout/stderr shown verbatim,
  separately capped at 64 Ki characters with a visible truncation notice. No
  persistence, automatic retry or stdin answers.
- Lifecycle: off/quit kill only the owned process tree and await close.
  Dispose latches against later starts; a pending discovery is invalidated by
  off or quit. A termination deadline reports failure rather than claiming
  the process ended.
- Trust/setup: trust prompts, `Workspace not trusted`, and the one-time enable
  prompt stop the server before opening normal interactive Claude Code for the
  person. The person completes setup and explicitly enables the switch again.
  Windows/macOS terminal launch is unit-tested with mocks; other platforms
  receive manual guidance.
- Observed: 40/40 new unit tests in four files passed with fake processes.
  Four deliberate regressions each failed the named assertion, then were
  restored. Full `_tools/gate.sh` via Git Bash passed, exit 0. `git diff
  --check` passed. Windows' default `bash` selected an unavailable WSL
  distribution; Git Bash ran the gate, with `LOCUST_GATE_TMP` set to a scratch
  folder of its own.
- Not run: real `claude remote-control`, account/sign-in checks, trust or
  enable answers, live UI, packaged UI, or a remote phone session. Review and
  merge before any release; W11 is built, not live.

### 2026-10-03 — comparison and drive polish (Codex)

- Ready for review: `exec/polish-batch`, based on `06e4a6c9`. Full file list,
  evidence paths and limitations are in `docs/HANDOFF-2026-10-03-POLISH.md`
  (development repository only).
- Four requested fixes: full comparison route tooltip (owned by
  Composer.tsx), styled judge select, stdout route probe, and a seeded Copy
  assertion with `--copy-only` mode.
- Gate exit 0; runtime-core 4/4 separately. Five new tests pass and all four
  requested regressions fail their named tests. Built-app drives: comparison
  8/8, seeded Copy 1/1, zero captured renderer errors.
- No version/CHANGELOG change, paid turn, packaging, push or publication.
  Live model round trips and packaged checks remain unverified.

### 2026-10-03 — research 3.2 real Codex fixtures and schema drift (Casper)

- Scope: `exec/3-2-casper`, fresh from `origin/main` at
  `06e4a6c9aa648ab1d391ef7a95ca096aa36a9592`. No production adapter change,
  push, publication, packaging, version bump or CHANGELOG edit.
- Observed live: installed Codex 0.160.0. Three retained recordings in
  `packages/runtime-adapters/test/fixtures/codex`: one approval declined, a
  file changed with host read-back, and an accepted mid-command steer. Paths,
  ids, machine metadata and timestamps scrubbed before persistence. The
  recorder is `_tools/record-codex-app-server-fixtures.mjs`, gated by
  `LOCUST_SPEND=1`.
- Observed tests: 9 new offline tests passed, one installed-CLI schema test
  skipped by default. Four negative controls failed their named assertions,
  then were restored. Final gate exit 0. `git diff --check` passed.
- Observed opt-in check: `LOCUST_CODEX_SCHEMA=1` generated the installed
  0.160.0 schema without a model call; the one installed-CLI test failed for
  exactly `ConfigWarningNotification.message` (the notification now carries
  `summary`). Fixed in the next entry.
- Not run: an exhausted provider limit, live configWarning, other Codex
  versions, packaged UI, or a release.

### 2026-10-03 — Codex app-server config warning fields (Gemini Flash)

- Scope: `exec/codex-warning`. Files: `packages/runtime-adapters/src/app-server-events.ts`,
  `packages/runtime-adapters/test/codex-schema-read-fields.ts`,
  `packages/runtime-adapters/test/a-config-warning-says-its-summary.test.ts`,
  this document.
- Outcome: `configWarning` notifications were dropped when `message` was
  missing. The normalizer now reads `params.summary` with optional
  `params.details` appended, falling back to `params.message`, and the
  read-fields inventory tracks `['summary', 'details']` so a later removal is
  caught.
- Validation: the new test failed 2 assertions on the un-fixed code, then
  passed 6/6; the opt-in schema test passed 5/5 against installed Codex CLI
  0.160.0; gate exit 0; `git diff --check` clean.
- Not run: a live session with a broken config making app-server push a
  `configWarning`; no model calls.
- Recommended next step: review and merge `exec/codex-warning` into main.

## First-launch teammate faces (2026-10-05)

- Branch: `exec/first-launch-blocked`. In renderer `status.ts`,
  `runtimeReach` leaves the global unusable verdict unknown while any check
  is pending, and `teammateStatusView` does not block on a pending own runtime.
  Checked missing or signed-out runtimes still block; this does not make a
  pending runtime usable for sending work.
- Regression tests: `a-teammate-is-not-stuck-while-agents-are-still-being-found.test.ts`.
  `_tools/control-first-launch-blocked.mjs` checks four deliberate regressions.
- `_tools/drive-pet-puppets.mjs --startup-only` records fresh-start faces and
  held discovery answers before `ready()`; `--observe-startup` also runs the
  full puppet checks. Neither sends a turn. The normal drive is unchanged
  unless an observation option is supplied.
- Evidence and verification limits: `docs/REPORT-2026-10-05-first-launch-blocked.md`.
