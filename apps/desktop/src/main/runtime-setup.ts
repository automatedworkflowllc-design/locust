/**
 * What each runtime has configured for itself: MCP servers and hooks, read
 * from the runtime's own files and shown, never changed.
 *
 * Colin, 2026-09-05, on hooks: "make sure the user actually knows what's
 * going on". A hook fires shell commands at points in a run; an MCP server
 * gives the runtime tools. Both are the runtime's own configuration, which
 * is why Locust adds none of its own (a Locust-level hook would fire beside
 * the runtime's, and a second MCP config would be one nothing reads). What
 * Locust owes is to SAY what is there, so a formatter that runs mid-mission
 * or a tool a teammate reaches for is not a surprise.
 *
 * Files are read with a byte bound and parsed leniently: a file that cannot
 * be read is named as unreadable, never guessed at. Only names are kept --
 * a server's command line and a hook's script can hold secrets, and the
 * screen needs neither.
