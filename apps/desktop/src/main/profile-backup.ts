/**
 * BACK UP AND RESTORE (0.614; the PRD's R21, its trust item T5).
 *
 * "The ledger is append-only, fsynced and integrity-checked. Everything else
 * is mutable JSON under userData ... There is no backup or restore and no
 * export of a profile. A new laptop or a wiped profile loses what the setup
 * sprint built." Item 6 as written: a folder with a manifest, keys excluded by
 * design, restore with a preview from the same reader, refuse a newer schema
 * and refuse while a run is live. No cloud and no migration.
 *
 * A BACKUP is a new folder, `Locust backup <date> <time>`, holding a copy of
 * the profile's own files under `profile/` and a manifest written LAST, so a
 * folder without one is a backup that did not finish. Every copied file is
 * named in the manifest with its size and SHA-256, read back from the copy.
 *
 * WHAT IT CARRIES is named, one file and one folder at a time, never
 * "everything but": a store added later is left out until it is classified
 * here (a-profile-backup-classifies-every-store guards that), so nothing new
 * is copied without a decision. Own-model keys are never carried: Windows
 * locks them to one account, and a key belongs in a keychain, not a folder.
 *
 * A RESTORE is read by the same reader as the preview, and refused when the
 * manifest is missing, a file does not match its hash, the backup came from a
 * newer Locust, or a run is going. It is not applied while the app holds its
 * stores in memory -- a store writing its old state back over the restored
 * file is the failure that would look like success. The request is written
 * down, the app restarts, and the restore is applied at the next start before
 * any store is read. What it replaces is moved aside into the profile, never
 * deleted, so a restore can be undone by hand.
