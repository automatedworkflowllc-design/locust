/**
 * The up arrow and Escape work on an ordinary composer, not only inside a menu.
 *
 * Ported from Claude Code on Colin's standing ask (2026-09-09): "if there's
 * any other quirks or cool features of Claude code that you can port over
 * that would be great."
 *
 * Both keys were already handled — but only in the branch that runs WHILE
 * THE SLASH MENU IS OPEN, where they move the menu selection and clear the
 * box. On an empty composer, with no menu, neither did anything: no recall
 * of the last message, no way to stop a run from the keyboard.
 *
 * That is the shape this guards. A future edit that moves either key back
 * inside the slash branch would restore exactly the old behaviour while
 * still looking, in a diff, like the key is handled.
 *
 * The behaviour itself is driven, not asserted here —
 * `_tools/probe-composer-keys.mjs` presses the real keys on the built app.
 * This session already shipped a feature whose two halves each had a passing
 * test and which was invisible on every runtime, so a source check gets to
 * guard a shape and nothing more.
