/**
 * OPEN A CONVERSATION IN THE RUNTIME'S OWN TERMINAL (0.387).
 *
 * Colin, 2026-09-26, looking at Orca, which runs every agent in a terminal
 * pane: "do you think we should maybe give an option in the chat to give the
 * user a terminal option for that model or no?" -- then, on the answer, "we
 * can either ship it in the three dot dropdown or have it more visible, or do
 * like a coding terminal button". Not a terminal INSIDE the conversation:
 * that is Orca's product, and a raw terminal skips Locust's approval cards,
 * spend limits and record. An escape hatch instead: the same session, in the
 * runtime's own interface, in the teammate's folder -- and honest that Locust
 * does not see what happens there.
 *
 * The session is the conversation's own (the host reads it from the ledger;
 * the window only names a mission), resumed with each CLI's own flag, as its
 * `--help` gave it on 2026-09-26:
 *
 *   codex 0.157.1      codex resume <SESSION_ID>
 *   claude 2.1.283     claude --resume <session-id>
 *   copilot 1.0.88     copilot --resume=<session-id>   (its own example's form)
 *   cursor-agent       cursor-agent --resume=<chatId>  (an optional value)
 *   opencode 1.18.27   opencode --session <id>
 *   muse 1.4.0         muse resume <session-ref>
 *   agy 1.2.14         agy --conversation <id>   (Antigravity CLI, 0.543)
 *
 * Antigravity is an app with a window of its own, and Gemini CLI does not run
 * here at all: neither is offered.
 *
 * Started the way the sign-in window is (runtime-sign-in.ts) -- no prompt,
 * no model text, only the program discovery found and a session id checked to
 * be a plain token -- in Windows Terminal when it is there, since these TUIs
 * are drawn for it, else in a console window of its own.
