/**
 * A store that cannot save must not answer as though it did.
 *
 * This is fault injection against the real filesystem rather than a stubbed
 * function: the store is pointed at a root that CANNOT hold its file, because
 * a plain file already sits where its directory needs to be. Every write then
 * fails the way a full or read-only disk fails, through the same syscalls, at
 * the same place.
 *
 * It exists because of what today produced. Three defects, all the same shape,
 * none of them in the saving mechanism -- the stores write-and-rename, which
 * is atomic, and the ledger truncates at the first torn line, which is
 * crash-consistent. The bugs were all in what happens when those mechanisms
 * REPORT a failure:
 *
 *   - a live run's receipt failure was discarded, and the run carried on
 *     working with nothing recorded (0.51.0)
 *   - the same on the Antigravity path, which additionally advanced its
 *     transcript cursor past events it had failed to write (0.51.1)
 *   - a failed settings write answered with hardcoded defaults, so the
 *     renderer showed switches that contradicted the file on disk
 *
 * The mechanism was never the weak part. The reporting was. So this pins the
 * one invariant that failure reporting rests on: **a mutating store call that
 * cannot reach the disk REJECTS.** Whatever a caller then chooses to do --
 * stop the run, tell the person, retry -- it can only do it if the call said
 * so, and every one of those three defects began with a call that did not.
