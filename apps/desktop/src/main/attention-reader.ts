/**
 * When a run ends, notice the two ways it can end WAITING FOR THE PERSON
 * that no notification covered: a decision card (the teammate asked a
 * question and stopped) and an account limit (the run stopped at a
 * checkpoint until a person picks where it continues). Approvals already
 * toast; rooms already toast; these were the parity map's remaining gap
 * (row 62) and needed no new screen -- the same attention path, two more
 * reasons.
 *
 * Decided from the record: the reply is rebuilt from the ledger and read
 * for an ask block; the limit is the event the adapter recorded. Nothing
 * is said for a run that ended any other way -- a person who stepped away
 * is told what needs them, not everything that happened.
