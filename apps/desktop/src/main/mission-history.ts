 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR, and it is the worst kind this app has shipped:

 *
 * Colin, 2026-09-20, with a screenshot of an empty group: *"both my stonks
 * and research chats are gone out of the stonks group, probably autorenamed
 * and moved, def need this fixed"*. Nothing was moved and nothing was
 * renamed. His ledger had 58 missions; this call returns the 20 most recently
 * touched; and his stonks conversations began on 14 and 15 September, so
 * their EARLIEST turns fell off the page. The renderer builds a row by
 * walking `continuesFrom` back through the missions it was given, so with
 * those turns absent the walk stopped early and the row's `rootId` became a
 * later turn. Everything hangs off that id:
 *
 *   - the title is the ROOT's first sentence, so the row renamed itself to a
 *     mid-conversation prompt — "looks autorenamed";
 *   - a name he typed is stored against the root, so it stopped matching;
 *   - group membership is stored against the root, so `stonks` matched
 *     nothing and read "Nothing in here yet" — "looks moved".
 *
 * Three symptoms, one cause, and no data involved in any of them: the
 * ledgers and `groups.json` were intact the whole time. Measured against his
 * real files before a line was changed.
 *
 * WHY IDENTITY ONLY. The page is bounded by bytes because a mission carries
 * up to 500 events and some of those are megabytes; raising the count would
 * just move the cliff. But a row needs its ancestors' IDS AND PROMPTS, not
 * their transcripts — a few hundred bytes each — so these are projected with
 * `events` emptied and appended after the budget. They cost nothing and they
 * make the row's identity independent of where the page happened to cut.
 *
 * This is a floor, not the whole answer. The real fix is a compact
 * conversation list that is not the same payload as the thread, so the
 * sidebar stops being a side effect of how much transcript fits in one IPC
 * message. Until then a very old conversation can still be short of turns
 * when opened — but it is in the right group, under its own name.
