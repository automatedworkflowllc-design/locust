/**
 * Teammates replying to each other without a person in the loop.
 *
 * Before this, a message from Wren to Booty waited in the workroom until
 * someone next messaged Booty, and Booty's answer waited until someone next
 * messaged Wren. Delivered, attributed, and not a conversation. The relay
 * closes that loop: when a run posts a share, the host may start a run for
 * the recipient with that share as its brief, and when THAT run posts back,
 * start the original sender's next turn so the answer lands in the thread
 * that asked.
 *
 * Three limits, each load-bearing:
 *
 *   - A switch in Settings, on by default. Talking to each other is the
 *     point of having more than one teammate; the cap is what bounds it.
 *   - The exchange ends when a reply carries no message: each hop is asked
 *     to write back only if that helps finish the work, and a run that
 *     posts no share starts nothing. The hop cap is a backstop for two
 *     agents thanking each other until the account is empty, not the
 *     length of a conversation.
 *   - A sender may ask to be taken NOW -- `when="now"` on the share block --
 *     and with the person's switch on, that stops the recipient's run so the
 *     message is their next one. Off by default and off is the ordinary
 *     state: it discards work in flight. The case it exists for is the one
 *     message that is useless late -- "stop, I am editing that file".
 *   - A recipient who is mid-run cannot take a second mission, so their
 *     reply is HELD and started the moment that run ends. Without this an
 *     exchange dies at its first collision: two teammates asked to argue
 *     answer at the same time, each writes to the other while the other is
 *     still working, and both messages sit undelivered forever. MEASURED
 *     2026-09-11 -- two participants, hop zero, nothing said back.
 *   - The recipient's run uses the RECIPIENT's own runtime, model and mode,
 *     the route a person last started them on. Grok answers as Grok, Fable
 *     as Fable; a teammate who has never run yet borrows the sender's route,
 *     and the thread says so. A route that cannot start is refused, not
 *     widened -- with one exception, said in the thread: Cursor lent `ask`
 *     on a machine that cannot hold it read-only runs as Accept edits,
 *     because `ask` there is a start the mission service refuses outright.
 *
 * Nothing about the record changes. A relayed run is an ordinary mission,
 * owned by the recipient, whose prompt is the host's brief; the messages it
 * was shown are recorded by id exactly as they are for a person's mission.
