/**
 * The settings search knows every setting that is actually on the page.
 *
 * `SETTINGS_PAGES` lists each page's headings so that typing "auto" finds
 * Auto mode rather than only matching page names. That list is written by
 * hand beside JSX that renders the headings, which is exactly the shape that
 * drifts: add a section, forget the index, and the search quietly stops
 * finding it. Nothing on screen looks wrong, which is what makes it bad.
 *
 * So the index is held to the file: every `lc-settings__heading` the screen
 * renders is in it, and nothing is in it that the screen does not render.
 *
 * Both files are READ rather than imported, which is how the other guards
 * here work (`classes-are-styled`, `says-what-is-still-true`): the main
 * tsconfig does not list renderer sources, and adding them to it to satisfy a
 * test would change what the app compiles.
