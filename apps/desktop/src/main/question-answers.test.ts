/**
 * A Codex question is ANSWERED. It was being authorized, and the answer was
 * thrown away.
 *
 * Astra settled the protocol on 2026-09-09 from the schema codex-cli 0.153.0
 * generates for itself, plus the version-matched upstream handler. Two facts
 * came out of it, and Locust had both wrong:
 *
 *   `item/tool/requestUserInput` carries a `questions` ARRAY -- each with an
 *   id, header, text, flags and nullable options. Locust read singular
 *   `params.question` / `prompt` / `message`, matched none of them, and drew a
 *   card that said "Answer a question" with no question on it.
 *
 *   Its reply is `{ answers: { <questionId>: { answers: [...] } } }`, keyed by
 *   question id, with a chosen option identified by its LITERAL LABEL --
 *   options carry no id and no index. Locust sent `{ decision: 'accept' }` for
 *   all three buttons. The server cannot deserialize that as an answer: it
 *   logs the failure, substitutes an EMPTY answer map, and tells the model the
 *   person said nothing.
 *
 * And one correction to what I had claimed: "Always allow this session" never
 * granted anything for a question. There is no session-grant field for one. It
 * failed deserialization like the other two, so its only effect was the same
 * empty answer, under a label promising something the protocol cannot mean.
 *
 * NOT VERIFIED HERE, and not claimed anywhere: no live pending question has
 * been answered, no malformed answer sent to a running server, no cancellation
 * race exercised. Those need a real turn and real quota. This is "built to the
 * published schema and unit-tested", which is weaker than "seen working".
