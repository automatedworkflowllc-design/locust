 * present, as the permission bridge's is), on the script beside app.asar.
 * Forward slashes: Windows takes them, and a backslash means something to a
 * shell. `--settings` applies under `--restricted` too (Claude Code's help), so
 * every mode gets it, Auto included.
 *
 * LOCUST_GUARD_PARENT (0.718) is this Locust's own process id: a process the
 * run started descends from the agent Locust started for it, whose parent is
 * Locust, and the guard ends only those by id.

 *
 * MEASURED 2026-10-10 on Codex 0.162.1, gpt-6-luna, app-server:
 * - Codex hands the hook Claude Code's own event (`tool_name: "Bash"`,
 *   `tool_input.command`) and honours its `permissionDecision: "deny"`: the
 *   command never ran and the model read the reason.
 * - On Windows it runs the hook as `powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command`, so
 *   the POSIX `NAME=value cmd` form and a bare quoted path both did nothing
 *   there; `$env:NAME='value'; & 'program' 'script'` ran. Elsewhere the
 *   command is the same as Claude Code's (not measured on a Mac).
 * - Codex runs only hooks the person has reviewed, and that review is kept in
 *   their config.toml, which Locust never writes. `bypass_hook_trust` runs
 *   this thread's hooks without it; without it the hook never ran. It skips
 *   the review for EVERY hook the thread loads, so it is only ever sent when
 *   Locust's is the only one there is: see `otherCodexHooks`.

/**
 * THE SAME GUARD FOR COPILOT (0.721): a plugin folder every Copilot run is

 * script as a PreToolUse hook.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-10-10 on Copilot CLI 1.0.95 (Auto, which ran gpt-6-luna):
 * - A `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with `hooks/hooks.json` beside it loads
 *   from `--plugin-dir` in a folder never trusted, in `-p` and in `--acp`
 *   alike. Copilot hands the hook Claude Code's own event (`tool_name:
 *   "Bash"` for its PowerShell tool, `tool_input.command`), and the matcher
 *   `Bash|PowerShell` takes it. A `permissionDecision: "deny"` stops the
 *   command ("Denied by preToolUse hook: <reason>"); over ACP it is refused
 *   before anyone is asked to approve it.
 * - On Windows it runs the hook as `powershell.exe -nop -nol -c`, as Codex
 *   does, so the command is Codex's.
 * - UNLIKE Claude Code and Codex, Copilot refuses the command when a hook
 *   fails: a hook that exited 1, or whose program was not there, denied
 *   `echo` ("hook errored"). A guard Locust could not start would stop every
 *   command a Copilot teammate runs. So the command cannot fail: PowerShell's
 *   `try {} catch {}; exit 0`, measured letting `echo` run with the program
 *   missing; `|| true` elsewhere (not measured on a Mac). The guard itself
 *   always exits 0, and refuses only by what it prints.
 * - Copilot keeps an empty folder per plugin path in ~/.copilot/plugin-data;
 *   nothing else of the person's is written.
