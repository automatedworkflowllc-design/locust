/**
 * Locust as Claude Code's permission host.
 *
 * Claude Code asks before using a connector tool, and a printed run has
 * nowhere to put that question -- so every call was refused, and 0.61.0
 * papered over it with a blanket allow rule per server. That works and it
 * is what Colin asked for, but it is not how any other client behaves:
 * everywhere else the model asks, the person answers, and "always" is
 * remembered.
 *
 * `--permission-prompt-tool` is the way to give a printed run somewhere to
 * ask. MEASURED 2026-09-10 with a throwaway server: the CLI calls the named
 * MCP tool with `{tool_name, input, tool_use_id}` and waits;
 * `{"behavior":"allow"}` lets the call through, `{"behavior":"deny",
 * "message"}` reaches the model verbatim. It works in `--print` under
 * `--restricted` in the strictest permission mode. It is connectors only --
 * Bash and Edit are granted by `--tools` and never route through it.
 *
 * The shape: a tiny stdio MCP server ships beside the app
 * (resources/locust-permission-bridge.mjs). Each run gets an `mcp.json`
 * naming it, with a loopback URL and a token minted for that run in its
 * environment. The bridge forwards each question here over HTTP; this file
 * turns it into the approval card the app already has, waits for the
 * person, and answers. A token that is not one this process minted is
 * refused before anything else in the request is read.
