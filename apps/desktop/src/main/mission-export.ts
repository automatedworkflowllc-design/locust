/**
 * SAVE THE RECORD: one conversation, as one Markdown file.
 *
 * A pure function from what the ledger holds -- the missions of one
 * conversation, oldest first -- to text. It reads nothing else and says
 * nothing the ledger does not: where the ledger is silent, the file says it is
 * silent, in those words, rather than leaving a gap that reads as "nothing
 * happened".
 *
 * WHAT THE LEDGER DOES NOT HOLD, and so what this file cannot say (read off
 * the code, 2026-10-03, not assumed):
 *   - An approval card that was ANSWERED YES. A card, and the person's answer
 *     to it, travel over IPC and are never written down; the call that was
 *     allowed simply runs, and looks like any call that needed no approval.
 *   - Who answered a card or how (a click, "don't ask again", a saved rule),
 *     except where the words recorded WITH a call say so: the host's own
 *     sentence for a saved rule's denial is carried into the call's output on
 *     the runtimes whose reply can carry it.
 *   - The folder a turn ran in. A mission records a workspace id; the path is
 *     passed in by the caller, from where it is kept now, and labelled so.
 *   - The Locust build that ran a turn. The build that WROTE the file is named.
 * What it does hold about approvals is the status of the call itself:
 * `declined` (the person's answer was no) and `refused` (the mode or runtime
 * said no before it ran). Those are listed; nothing is inferred beyond them.
