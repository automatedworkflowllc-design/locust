/**
 * No harness may select something this app cannot draw.
 *
 * A drive that queries a class the renderer no longer produces gets back
 * nothing — and nothing is exactly what a missing feature looks like. So the
 * app changes, a drive keeps passing or keeps reporting an absence, and the
 * lie survives until someone spends an afternoon on it.
 *
 * That has happened three times in this repo. Drives guarded on an `is-open`
 * class `ActivityCard` has never set, so the guard was always true. A drive
 * read the user's message bubble as `.lc-msg, .lc-turn, [class*="user"]`,
 * matched nothing, printed `[]`, and a screenshot happened to cover for it.
 * `verify-firstrun` counted runtime rows with three selectors that between
 * them matched none, and printed `runtime rows: []` as if that were an answer.
 *
 * The rule here is narrow on purpose: a `querySelector` string is a failure
 * only when it names at least one `lc-` class and NONE of the classes in it
 * exist. A selector with one live branch is fine — that is what a fallback
 * chain is for — and a selector with no `lc-` class at all is not this test's
 * business.
 *
 * `aria-label` selectors are checked too, and they rot the same way: a changed
 * avatar title once broke 68 of them at once. Only EXACT (`[aria-label="x"]`)
 * and PREFIX (`[aria-label^="x"]`) forms, against every string literal the app
 * puts in an `aria-label` — including the ones inside a JSX expression, which
 * is the false-positive mode this check had on its first run. It reported five
 * dead selectors for `Save as routine` and `Edit routine`; both live inside
 * `aria-label={editing ? 'Edit routine' : 'Save as routine'}`, and "fixing"
 * those five would have broken two working smokes. The app was read before
 * anything was changed, which is the only reason it did not happen.
 *
 * A label built entirely from a variable cannot be judged here and is not
 * claimed to be.
