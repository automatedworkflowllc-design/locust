/**
 * Let a Cursor run outside Auto call the connectors the person configured.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-09-15/16 in Colin's own ledger: 17, 5, 3 and 2 `user
 * rejected MCP` per run in Accept edits, 0 in Auto. `--approve-mcps` approves
 * the SERVER; each CALL still asks, and a print-mode run has nobody to answer,
 * so every call resolved to "no". The effective policy was not "safer", it
 * was "always no" -- for servers the person set up themselves and that
 * Cursor's own app uses freely.
 *
 * Making Accept edits pass `--force` would be wrong: that is Auto for shell
 * commands under another name. Cursor's CLI reads permissions from
 * `<workspace>/.cursor/cli.json` -- `Mcp(<server>:<tool>)` patterns with `*`
 * wildcards, deny winning over allow (cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/
 * permissions) -- the same shape Colin's own `~/.cursor/cli-config.json`
 * already holds four Robinhood tools in. So at the start of a Cursor run
 * outside Auto, `Mcp(<server>:*)` for each configured server is merged into
 * that file's allow list. `deny` is never touched, and a file that does not
 * parse is left alone rather than written over.
 *
 * TAKEN BACK WHEN THE RUN ENDS. The rules used to stay for good, so a later
 * Ask run in the same folder inherited connector access it was never given,
 * and the folder kept a file the person did not write. Now a grant comes with
 * a `release`: it removes exactly the rules THIS run added -- not ones that
 * were there before, not ones the person added meanwhile, not `deny` -- and
 * deletes the file (and `.cursor/`) when the run created them and nothing
 * else is left in them. Two runs in one folder hold a rule together: it goes
 * when the last holder ends.
 *
 * Colin, 2026-09-10: "just let them have access to the mcp tools if the
 * client has access to it." The mode governs this machine; a connector the
 * person set up in Cursor themselves is not this machine. Decided 2026-09-17
 * (`docs/HARNESS-COMMUNICATION-2026-09-17.md`).
