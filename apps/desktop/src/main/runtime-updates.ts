/**
 * KEEPING THE CODING AGENTS CURRENT.
 *
 * Colin, 2026-09-23: "new gpt-6 models released we need those added", and
 * then "is there a way to make it so the models will automatically update
 * without messing up load times or interfering with the app". The model lists
 * are already read live from each agent (model-catalog.ts); what goes stale is
 * the agent. Codex CLI 0.153.0 listed GPT-6-Astra; 0.156.1 adds GPT-6-Sol and
 * GPT-6-Luna. Claude Code, OpenCode and Cursor Agent keep themselves current;
 * Codex and Copilot, installed with npm, never do -- and Locust runs them
 * headless, so the notice Codex prints about a newer version is seen by no one.
 *
 * So, for those two:
 *
 * - LOOK, never on the way up. The first look waits until the app has been up
 *   a while (FIRST_LOOK_AFTER_MS), and again at most every CHECK_EVERY_MS. A
 *   look is one `npm view` per agent, and what it saw is kept on disk, so a
 *   launch inside that window goes to the network not at all.
 * - UPDATE ONLY WHAT NOTHING IS USING. No process may be running from the
 *   agent's own folder -- every mission Locust runs on it, and anything else
 *   on this machine that runs that copy. (The Codex app keeps a copy of its
 *   own under AppData\Local\OpenAI, and running it does not hold this one.)
 *   And only a release out for RELEASE_AGE_MS: one pulled within hours of
 *   going out never lands here.
 * - ONLY WHAT NPM PUT THERE. An agent found somewhere npm did not install it
 *   is left alone: `npm install -g` would put a second copy beside it.
 * - Then the machine is asked again and the models re-read, so the new ones
 *   are in the picker without a restart.
 *
 * A switch in Settings turns it off; off, a newer version is still reported.
 *
 * AND IT ASKS FIRST (0.303). A beta tester, the evening 0.302 went out: "when
 * I sent the prompt everything on the computer disconnected from internet ...
 * I stopped it and closed locust and everything went back to normal", in the
 * middle of a Google Meet, with Locust saying "reconnecting". Codex CLI's
 * update is one npm package of 159 MB (0.156.1's win32 tarball, measured), and
 * 0.302 started it by itself 45 s after launch: on an ordinary home line that
 * is a minute or two of the whole connection. Nothing on this machine can
 * know that someone is on a call, or on a slow line. So the LOOK stays
 * automatic -- a few kilobytes -- and the DOWNLOAD is the person's: the row
 * says a newer version is out and offers Update. Updating on its own is a
 * switch they turn on, and it starts OFF -- a new saved key, so every 0.302
 * install that had it on by default starts off again.
 *
 * ON AGAIN BY DEFAULT (0.304). Colin: "automatic updating for the models
 * should be fine, i dont think thats what knocked out his internet" -- and
 * the tester's connection went again, and again only on Codex runs, which
 * one download cannot explain. So it updates on its own unless the person
 * turned that off; the Update button stays for anyone who does. Only a
 * choice the person made is kept (`chosen`): 0.303 saved OFF for everyone
 * who never touched the switch, and that is not a choice.
 */

/**
 * Whether this launch may change the machine's agents at all. A script drives
 * the app with `--remote-debugging-port` -- more than seventy drives do, each
 * on a throwaway profile -- and a drive that updated the Codex every other
 * session on this machine runs would be a test with a side effect no one
 * asked for. `LOCUST_UPDATE_AGENTS=1` lets a drive that is about updating do
 * it (drive-agents-kept-current points npm at a folder of its own first).
