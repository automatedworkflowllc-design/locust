/**
 * A2.16: APPROVALS NEVER RIDE ON A TEAMMATE'S MESSAGE.
 *
 * CHECKED 2026-09-24: an approval -- a Codex action, a Claude Code connector
 * permission, an Antigravity question -- is answered in exactly one place,
 * the MISSION_APPROVAL_DECIDE handler, which takes only the app's own window
 * (`fromOwnWindow`): a person's click. A run the relay started raises its
 * cards like any other and nothing auto-answers them. Nothing a teammate
 * writes -- a share, a relayed brief, a returned answer -- reaches `decide`.
 *
 * This keeps it that way: every call of `.decide(` in the main process is in
 * the modules that hold approvals, or in that one handler. A new caller -- a
 * relay path, a block parser -- fails here and has to say why it may.
