/**
 * What the host actually ran, in a form safe to keep and safe to send.
 *
 * Chasing why every Copilot mission failed on 2026-09-05 took eight
 * experiments, and every one of them was reconstructing the command by
 * reading `commands.ts` and hoping the reconstruction matched. It would have
 * taken one if the record had said. That is a diagnostic gap in normal times
 * and a blocking one for a beta: a tester's machine cannot be borrowed, and
 * "it failed" without the argv is a question nobody can answer remotely.
 *
 * Two rules make it safe to keep.
 *
 * The PROMPT NEVER APPEARS. Codex and Claude take it on stdin, but OpenCode
 * and Copilot take it as an argument, so a naive argv would copy the person's
 * words into the header of every mission -- doubling them in the file and,
 * worse, putting them somewhere a "send me your ledger" request would carry
 * them. The ledger already holds the prompt once, deliberately and in one
 * place. Here it is replaced by a marker, matched by VALUE rather than by
 * position, because the flag it follows differs per runtime.
 *
 * And it is BOUNDED. A record that can grow with its input is a record that
 * can be used to bloat the file it lives in.
