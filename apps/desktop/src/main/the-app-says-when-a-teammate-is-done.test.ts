/**
 * KNOW WHEN A TEAMMATE IS DONE (0.379), the wiring between the pieces.
 *
 * Each piece is tested on its own -- keep-awake.ts, taskbar-attention.ts,
 * attention.ts (runFinished), finishedToast.ts. What a unit test cannot hold
 * is that the host, the preload and the window are joined up; a drive
 * cannot show a toast (mayShowToasts refuses them to scripted launches), so
 * the joins are pinned here, at the source.
