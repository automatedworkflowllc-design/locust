/**
 * WHERE FEEDBACK GOES -- one address, named here, in the host.
 *
 * Settings' Report a problem showed the log and said "this is the file to
 * send", and said nowhere where to send it (the beta handover, 2026-09-23).
 * A tester who got stuck left without a trace, and there is no telemetry, by
 * design, so what testers send is the only signal there is.
 *
 * Colin: "for bug reporting we can use what claude code does" -- its Send
 * feedback box: describe the issue, a line saying exactly what goes with it,
 * Cancel and Send. Claude Code sends to its makers' own service; Locust has
 * none. So Send builds the report and opens it on GitHub, filled in, and the
 * person sends it there (it needs a GitHub account). The destination is this
 * one constant: whether it stays GitHub issues or becomes Discord or GitHub
 * Discussions is Colin's call, and it changes this line only.
 *
 * What goes: the person's own words, the Locust version and the Windows
 * build, and -- when it was sent from a conversation -- that conversation's
 * text, the latest of it if it is long. Never the log, never a path, never
 * a file: the person attaches the log themselves, and the report says how.
 *
 * The renderer names no address here (see OPEN_LINK_CHANNEL in index.ts):
 * it hands over the words, and the host builds the address itself.
