/**
 * Which drawing each orb uses, pinned — because it was decided by looking and
 * nothing else in the suite can see it.
 *
 * The library ships TWO drawings per orb and says so in its own types:
 * *"Exactly two tuned presets ship: 64 (chat-avatar scale) and 20
 * (inline-text scale). Each size carries its own dot count, dot size and
 * speed tuning — they are separate designs, not a scale factor."*
 *
 * Locust shipped the 20 design everywhere, and Colin held the app up next to
 * the library's page: *"the one we have set for 'using a tool' doesnt even
 * look like any of the ones in that asset pack lol"*. Nothing had been
 * redrawn — all 23 files are byte-identical to the published tarball. It was
 * the other design: at 20 the web keeps 19% of its points at 1.5x the size.
 *
 * The split is by what carries the shape. Density shapes take the 64 asset
 * painted down; OUTLINE shapes keep the 20 design, because at 64 their lines
 * are hairline-thin and vanish into the panel.
