/**
 * EVERY FOLDER LOCUST HAS WORKED IN, BY ID AND PATH (0.458).
 *
 * Colin, 2026-09-29: "Just make it work exactly like Claude code ... Claude
 * allows you to switch work folder but also has projects grouped." A
 * conversation belongs to a folder, and the sidebar lists every folder's
 * conversations under its name (docs/PLAN-2026-09-29-FOLDERS-LIKE-CLAUDE-CODE.md).
 *
 * A mission records its folder only as `workspaceId` -- a hash of the path --
 * so the path has to be kept somewhere to continue a conversation there. This
 * is that somewhere: `folders.json`, written whenever a folder is worked in.
 * A folder from before it existed is recovered from the conversation's own
 * record (`recoverFolderPath`).
