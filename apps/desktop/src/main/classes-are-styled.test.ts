/**
 * Every `lc-` class a component writes is a class the stylesheet knows.
 *
 * A class name with no rule behind it does not warn, does not fail, and does
 * not look wrong in the source: the element renders, carries the name, and
 * draws nothing. It is the same silent defect as the undefined `--lc-border`
 * token that `css-tokens-exist` was written for, one level up.
 *
 * Written 2026-09-09, immediately after styling a button as
 * `lc-button--quiet` -- a name nothing defined -- while building the
 * teammate folder row. On its first run it found four more, all on the
 * Automations screen: `lc-screen__head`, `lc-screen__lede`, `lc-screen__note`
 * and `lc-section__title`. Every other screen's header is a 60px chrome bar
 * with a hairline and 24px of side padding, drawn by `lc-screen__header`;
 * Automations asked for `__head`, got nothing, and had been shipping a title
 * flush against the window edge.
 *
 * Names built by interpolation are out of scope on purpose. `lc-tone-${...}`
 * cannot be read from the source, and `tone-classes-win` is the control that
 * covers those.
