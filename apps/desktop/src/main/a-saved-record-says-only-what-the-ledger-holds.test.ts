 *
 * What is seeded is what the ledger can hold: a call the person declined, a
 * call a saved rule's sentence names, a call the mode refused, a hand-off to
 * another runtime with its checkpoint, a diff the ledger kept short, a result
 * it was too large to keep, a message between teammates, a run that failed, a
 * check the person ran, and a file whose tail was torn. It cannot hold an
 * approval that was allowed, or who answered a card; the file says so, and
 * these tests pin that it does rather than pretend.
