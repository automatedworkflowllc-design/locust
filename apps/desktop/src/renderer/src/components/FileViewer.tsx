/**
 * A file a teammate wrote, open beside the conversation.
 *
 * Colin, 2026-09-20: *"is there a way like what claude code has where when you
 * click a file/md it opens it over here near where our activity would be if
 * opened? would be a good QOL update."* Until now a teammate wrote you a
 * report and the app's best offer was a file manager.
 *
 * It shares the inspector's region rather than inventing one. That region
 * already knows how to sit beside the thread without covering the composer --
 * which cost a release to get right (0.187.0, at 1120x720) -- and a second
 * drawer would be a second answer to "what is this panel".
 *
 * IT RENDERS AND IT NEVER RUNS. Markdown goes through `AgentText`, the same
 * renderer every reply uses: React escapes every value, so nothing in the
 * file can become markup, and links go through the host's own outbound rules
 * rather than the browser's. Anything else is monospace in its own scroll box.
 * A file in this workspace was written by a MODEL, which is the same threat
 * model as a reply and the reason `shell.openPath` is refused in
 * `reveal-file.ts`. Do not add an "open externally" control here.
