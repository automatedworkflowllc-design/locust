/**
 * One orb, drawn from the asset that actually looks like the asset.
 *
 * THE LIBRARY SHIPS TWO DRAWINGS PER ORB, and its own types say why:
 * *"Exactly two tuned presets ship: 64 (chat-avatar scale) and 20
 * (inline-text scale). Each size carries its own dot count, dot size and
 * speed tuning — they are separate designs, not a scale factor."*
 *
 * The 20 preset is therefore a deliberate design, not a degraded one — but
 * it is a different picture, and how different is measurable from the
 * library's own preset table: at 20 the rubik keeps 25% of its points at
 * 1.8x the dot size, and the web keeps 19% at 1.5x. Colin, looking at the
 * shipped app beside the library's page: *"the one we have set for 'using a
 * tool' doesnt even look like any of the ones in that asset pack lol"*. He
 * was right, and nothing had been redrawn — all 23 files are byte-identical
 * to the published tarball. We were simply showing the other design.
 *
 * So this renders the 64 asset into a box smaller than 64. That is a
 * DOWNSCALE, which is sharp — the opposite of the first attempt, a CSS
 * transform on the 20px raster, which Colin correctly called cooking the
 * resolution.
 *
 * `box` is the space it gets, and it is a real dial rather than a constant
 * because some of these need more room than others to read at all. Colin,
 * setting the expectation before the work: *"its certainly possible once we
 * do this that some of these assets will either need to be given more
 * space/size to be legibile or we might have to scrap them altogether for
 * ones that are more visible to the naked eye"*.
 *
 * WHERE THE 20 PRESET IS STILL RIGHT: below about 18px there is not enough
 * room for the 64 asset's point count and it turns to mud. The sidebar's
 * conversation row is that case, and it keeps the inline design it was
 * designed for.
 */
/**
 * Which shapes the 64 asset actually improves, decided by rendering all nine
 * in the live line's own geometry and looking.
 *
 * THE RULE THE PICTURES MADE: the 64 asset wins wherever a shape's identity
 * is carried by POINT DENSITY -- the rubik's bands, the web's constellation,
 * the braid's strands, the globe's and wave's surfaces, the ribbon's sash.
 * At 20 those are a handful of fat dots and the shape is unrecognisable,
 * which is exactly what Colin saw: *"the one we have set for 'using a tool'
 * doesnt even look like any of the ones in that asset pack lol"*.
 *
 * It LOSES wherever the shape is an OUTLINE. `shaping` is a dotted square and
 * `breathing` a dotted ring: at 64 their outlines are hairline-thin and fade
 * into the panel, while the 20 preset deliberately fattens them, which is the
 * whole reason that design exists. Colin predicted this before the work --
 * *"some of these assets will either need to be given more space/size to be
 * legibile or we might have to scrap them altogether"* -- and the answer for
 * those two is neither: they already have a design tuned for this size.
 *
 * So the preset is chosen per shape. Mixing them is not an inconsistency: the
 * nine are different drawings anyway, and the thing that must be consistent
 * is that each one READS.

 * THE 64 DESIGN, PAINTED DOWN WELL.
 *
 * Colin, 2026-09-22: "make sure they are as sharp as they can be ... is there
 * anyway you would improve on them visually". The designs were never the
 * problem -- every file is the published tarball's -- but the LAST STEP was.
 * The library sizes its canvas by its preset, 64 CSS px, and this box is 26,
 * so the browser shrank a finished 64px bitmap by 2.46 on every frame. At a
 * ratio that is not a whole number, and more than two, the compositor's
 * filter samples some of a dot's pixels and skips others: dots flared,
 * vanished, and swapped as they moved.
 *
 * MEASURED against the best picture 26 device pixels can hold -- the same
 * frame drawn 8x larger and averaged down exactly -- at eight moments of all
 * six density shapes (scratchpad orbs/score.py, 2026-09-22):
 *
 *   the library's 64 canvas shrunk by CSS  mean error 10.4, swinging up to 1.3 frame to frame
 *   drawn by the engine straight at 26     17.7 (sub-pixel dots are painted fat)
 *   drawn at exactly 2x, shrunk by CSS      5.3
 *   drawn at 4x, shrunk with 'high'         0.9, steady to 0.08
 *
 * So: the library's own engine and presets (`resolvePreset`, `MODE_DRAWS`,
 * the 64 design, its speed), drawn four times larger than the box, and
 * shrunk by the canvas with high-quality smoothing -- the same "bigger asset
 * painted down" rule as before, done by a filter that looks at every pixel.
 * Everything else the library does is kept: a still frame for reduced
 * motion, and no drawing while the orb is off screen or the window hidden.
