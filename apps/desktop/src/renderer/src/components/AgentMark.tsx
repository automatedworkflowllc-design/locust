/**
 * AN AGENT'S MARK ON HOME, AND WHAT IT KNOWS ON HOVER (0.389).
 *
 * 0.388 ringed each mark with its account's usage, and the row of marks lost
 * the calm it had. Colin, 2026-09-27: "it was just very clean showing the
 * agents earlier ... im sure you can cook up something better", then "when you
 * hover the logo the usage window can appear" -- and, of 0.388, "the hover
 * logo wasnt working": an SVG's own title is not a hover a person can rely on.
 *
 * So the row is marks again, and each mark is a thing to point at: hover or
 * focus it and a card opens above it -- the agent's name and state, and one
 * bar for each usage window its last run reported, with when it resets. A bar
 * is amber from 80% and red when the window is spent, the tones the app uses
 * for "may not finish" and "stopped". Upward, because the row sits just over
 * the message box.
 *
 * Only what the runs reported (Claude's windows; Codex's since 0.388). An
 * agent that reported none gets its name and state alone, not an empty meter.
