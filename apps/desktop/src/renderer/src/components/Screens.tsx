              When a teammate writes to another, the other can answer on their own: Locust starts a run for
              them with the message as its brief, and their answer starts the sender&rsquo;s next turn, so it
              lands in the thread that asked. They keep going while a reply helps finish the work, and stop
              when one has nothing more to say, or when the budget below is spent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each teammate answers on their own route — their runtime, model and mode, not the sender&rsquo;s --
              which is how two models end up on one piece of work. Switch replies off to make messages wait
              for you instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              A teammate does one thing at a time, so a message that arrives while they are working waits
              until that run ends. A sender can mark a message urgent when waiting would make it useless --
              &ldquo;stop, I am editing that file&rdquo; is the case it exists for. Letting that stop the
              recipient part-way throws away whatever they had in flight, so it is off until you turn it on;
              their unfinished work stays in their own conversation either way.

              is holding it. A model that reports no levels is unaffected — there is nothing to raise.

              Every other mode confines a run to the folder you chose for it, and a runtime that wants to
              touch anything outside it is refused. Auto is the mode that does not: a run started in Auto
              goes ahead without asking and may read and change files anywhere this computer lets you,
              including outside the folder.
            </p>

              It exists because some work genuinely lives in more than one place. Auto is always in the
              composer's permission menu and picking it there is what switches it on, so this is the same
              decision seen from the other side: what is on now, and the way to take it back. It is checked
              again each time a run starts — switching it off here stops the next run, including one a
              teammate or a routine was about to start — and it is never the mode a malformed or missing
              choice falls back to.

              Codex, Cursor and OpenCode each have a tool for keeping a todo list, and the board in a room

              mark one in progress, mark it done when it is done.
            </p>

              It is off by default because it is not free — the bookkeeping costs tokens and changes how a

              A teammate's reply is the one thing on this screen you read rather than scan, so it is set
              in its own face and sized on its own. Your own messages and a teammate's question cards grow
              with it; the rest of the app stays where it is whatever you pick here.
            </p>
            <p>
              The line length follows the size rather than staying put, so a bigger reply gets a wider
              paragraph and about the same number of words to a line. Measured, not assumed: roughly 74
              characters at Standard and 72 at Large.

              Every option here is one the design pass put forward, on screen rather than buried in the

            <p>
              Its recommendation was silver at Standard, on hover only — the argument being that in this
              app a thing that moves means work is happening, so a button that shimmers all the time says
              "running" on a screen where nothing is. Always on is here so you can disagree with that
              after looking at it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Off is not only a matter of taste: the effect is WebGL, and a plain button costs nothing and
              cannot fail to appear.

              Finding the AI agents on this machine takes as long as it takes — each one is a real command
              and some of them are slow to answer. The screen shows that happening rather than a spinner
              standing in for it, and every line on it is something the app actually read.

              It only ever covers the empty middle of the window. The sidebar, the folder and the message
              box stay where they are, so you can pick a teammate or start typing without waiting for it,
              and clicking anywhere on it puts it away.
