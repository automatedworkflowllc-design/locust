/**
 * UNDO A TURN (0.674): the way back from what one finished turn changed in the folder.
 *
 * Claude Code rewinds; a Locust turn wrote straight into the folder and there was no way back short of
 * the person's own git. Locust now keeps the folder as it was before each turn that may write
 * (main/checkpoints.ts), and the turn's foot offers to put back what the turn changed. Asked first, in
 * words, because it changes files: how many, and that a file changed since is left as it is. Afterwards
 * it says what it did, and names each file it left alone and why.
 *
 * Nothing is drawn for a turn with no way back -- one that changed nothing, one that shared its folder
 * with another run (what changed cannot be told apart), one from before 0.674 -- so a turn reads as it
 * always has unless there is something to offer.
