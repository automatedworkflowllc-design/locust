           * answering*, the composer said *A coding agent is installed but
           * not answering — Check again above*, and the four that were

           * their Check again was a press away behind a control that gave no
           * reason to press it.
           *
           * My own measurement could not have caught it: the frame I designed
           * this against was taken on a machine with nothing installed, where

           * not the same rows.
           *
           * `installed` and not `connected`: a signed-out Codex is installed,
