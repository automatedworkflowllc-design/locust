/**
 * SIGN IN, as a button.
 *
 * The row used to print `run muse login` and stop. Colin, 2026-09-22: signed
 * in to Meta in his browser, told to sign in again, with no idea where. A CLI
 * cannot borrow the browser's session, so the sign-in itself stays; the
 * terminal hunt goes. Pressing this opens the runtime's own sign-in in a
 * window of its own, and the row turns ready by itself once Locust is back
 * in front and asks again.
 *
 * The command stays reachable: it is the button's title, and it is what the
 * row falls back to when the window cannot be opened.
