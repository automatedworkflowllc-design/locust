/**
 * THE PETS LOCUST OFFERS, AS TILES IN THE LOOK PICKER (0.564).
 *
 * 0.563 browsed openpets.dev's whole gallery here: search, Featured or
 * Originals, a page of tiles and More. Colin kept the 21 he had added from it
 * and asked for *"all the others"* to go (shared/pet-picks.ts), so the Pets
 * row is those 21, always there: no search, no paging. A tile shows the pet's
 * small picture -- light to show, where 21 live sheets were seconds of
 * decoding. A pet not on this computer yet downloads from openpets.dev on its
 * click and goes on the teammate; the credit line says so once (0.565: an
 * arrow on each tile put 21 arrows on a new computer's row).
 * Nothing is downloaded before a click, and each pet's rights stay with its
 * maker (PetCredit says so, and where to report one).
