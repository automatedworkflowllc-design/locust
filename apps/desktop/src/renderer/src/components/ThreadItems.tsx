/**
 * A plan's steps, in either of the two jobs a plan does.
 *
 * One component with one question behind it -- **does this plan have step
 * outcomes** -- because markers versus ordinals, meta size versus reading
 * size, and header versus none all follow from that single answer. Two
 * components that looked alike is what let the same markup do the wrong job in
 * one of the two places (design, 2026-09-09).
 *
 * `outcomes: true` -- inside an activity fold. A run happened, the steps have
 * states, and the counter is a fact about it. Markers, meta size, and the
 * `PLAN · 2 of 5 done` header. Exactly as shipped; do not touch.
 *
 * `outcomes: false` -- a Plan-mode turn, which is the whole answer to the
 * question and has no fold to live in. It was a bordered card with a `PLAN`
 * label, a `0 of 5 done` counter and five identical dots, which read as a run
 * stalled at step one. All three of those were reporting on a run that by
 * contract never happened:
 *
 *   - A dot is a STATE, meaning "not done yet". Nothing was attempted and
 *     nothing will be, so five dots say something false five times. Ordinals
 *     say the true thing instead -- order, which is the entire content of a
 *     plan.
 *   - The counter counts outcomes there are none of.
 *   - The `PLAN` label only ever named which kind of box you were looking at,
 *     and there is no box. The teammate's own sentence above the list says
 *     what it is better than a five-letter caption.
 *
 * A real `<ol>`, so it is an ordered list to a screen reader as well as to the
 * eye. The ordinals are `user-select: none`, so copying the plan yields the
 * steps and not the numbering.

/**
 * The plan card's two orbs, and why they are two.
 *
 * THE HISTORY, because this one moved three times and each move was a real
 * finding. Colin asked for the rubik on the step underway -- *"i see it plan
 * consistently and i think it would look alot better as one of the more
 * spherical assets"*. It went there, then away when `solving` took every open
 * tool (two identical spheres a few pixels apart on one screen reads as a
 * glitch), then back when `solving` narrowed to connectors.
 *
 * AND THEN IT LOST ON ITS OWN MERITS, which is the part worth keeping: *"might
 * have to give up on rubix cube as the plan indicator... put the full sized
 * rubix next to PLAN so the user can see the plan is active, and then use the
 * previous smaller pulsing/bouncing sphere... for the active part of the
 * plan."*
 *
 * That is the same rule that cut the web and the braid, arriving on the orb we
 * had just fought to keep: A SHAPE MADE OF SCRAMBLING BANDS NEEDS ROOM. An
 * 11px row marker is not room. It is not that the rubik is wrong for a plan --
 * it is that a row marker is the wrong SIZE for a rubik. So the rubik goes
 * where there is room, once per card, and says what a card-level mark should
 * say: this plan is running.
 *
 * The step took `working` first -- four particles on tilted orbits -- and that
 * lasted one look: *"the particles were using rn are a little scattered for
 * that task"*. Right again, and for a reason worth keeping: a plan step is a
 * DISCRETE unit of work, and a mark made of loose particles says diffuse. A
 * step underway wants something that reads as one solid thing.
 *
 * So it is `listening` at the library's INLINE drawing -- the 20 preset at
 * 20px, which Colin picked by pointing at that cell on a contact sheet:
 * *"its honestly different enough from everything else and i think it would
 * work with the plan structure"*. At that size it is a small dense sphere,
 * which is exactly what a discrete unit of work should look like.
 *
 * NOTE THE ONE COLLISION IT ACCEPTS. `listening` is also the live line's
 * THINKING orb, and the plan card and the live line can be on screen at once
 * -- which is the very thing that cost the rubik this slot. It is a weaker
 * version of that problem: these are different drawings of the same shape
 * (inline 20 here, the 64 asset there) at different sizes and at opposite
 * ends of the view, where the rubik's clash was the same drawing at the same
 * size a few pixels apart. Colin made the call knowing the shape; if the two
 * ever read as one thing on screen, this is the line to come back to.
