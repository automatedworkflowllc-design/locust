/**
 * A MODEL IS ONE LINE IN THE PICKER, the way Claude Code's and Codex's own
 * pickers draw them.
 *
 * Each row's second line carried the catalogue's description, the resolved
 * name and every effort level -- "Newest fable model · resolved by Claude
 * Code at launch · 5 effort levels · low, medium, high, xhigh, max" -- and
 * wrapped to three lines at the picker's width, so about four models fitted
 * in view (frames, 2026-09-22). The effort levels are what nobody chooses a
 * model by; they move to the row's hover, and the row keeps the rest.
