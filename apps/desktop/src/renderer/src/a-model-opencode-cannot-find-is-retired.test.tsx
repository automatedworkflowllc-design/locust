 * 0.712, from the first hour on a bare Mac (_smoke/mac-first-hour-smoke.mjs,

 * the chat box was on Fledge Alpha: a fresh OpenCode 1.18.35 lists the models
 * its binary was built with until it next reads models.dev, and Fledge Alpha
 * -- first of the free ones once Exo was left out -- was among them. The first
 * message a new person sent ended on this line, with nothing to press.
