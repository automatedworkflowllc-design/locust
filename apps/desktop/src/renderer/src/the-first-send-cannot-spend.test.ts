/**
 * Sol's beta review, 2026-09-21, finding 1 — the only one of the nine that
 * can cost a new person money.
 *
 * > After Install, the composer is Account Default... The one runtime that
 * > needs no account should come up on a named free model, so the first Send
 * > cannot spend.
 *
 * Reproduced twice, on 0.239 and again on 0.242: install OpenCode from the
 * welcome screen — the runtime we recommend BY NAME because it needs no
 * account — and the composer lands on `OpenCode / Account Default`. That is
 * "whatever this account gives you", which on a signed-in account is a
 * billable model somebody else chose, sitting behind the first Enter.
 *
 * The rule is FIRST LISTED FREE, never a named model. Hardcoding
 * `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` here would be the bet
 * `freeStartStillFree` exists to refuse: somebody else's catalogue, changed
 * on somebody else's clock, baked into our first-run path.
