     * `solving` on tools cost the PLAN its rubik, which was Colin's own
     * earlier pick: the plan's step and the live line are on screen TOGETHER
     * during a run, and two identical spheres animating a few pixels apart is

 * `a-refusal-is-not-a-crash.test.ts` pins this exact phrase against the
 * message its normalizer builds, so the adapter cannot reword it without
 * failing there. Both halves name the phrase; neither can move alone.
