/**
 * The model picker is the differentiator, so it has to read like one.
 *
 * The catalogue falls back to a model's ID when the runtime reports no
 * display name for it, and OpenCode's free models report none. So the picker
 * listed `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` in a column where every other row
 * read as a proper name -- with the composer chip an inch below it reading
 * "Muse Spark 1.3 Contributor Free", because chips and mission rows have gone
 * through `modelDisplayName` since Grok's first pass found the same
 * inconsistency there. The picker was the last untreated spot.
 *
 * Both halves matter and the second is the one that could go wrong: this
 * spells out IDENTIFIERS. A name the runtime actually gave is the runtime's
 * own product name and is printed exactly as it wrote it.
