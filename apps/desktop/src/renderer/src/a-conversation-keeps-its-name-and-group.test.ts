/**
 * A conversation keeps its name and its group across its own turns.
 *
 * Colin, 2026-09-16: *"ive named a conversation 'code' and moved it to a
 * group named locust twice and it keeps disappearing"* — then, precisely:
 * *"it actually didnt disappear it just renamed itself and left the group."*
 *
 * Two symptoms, one cause, and his ledger showed it plainly:
 * `mission_77ef58ad` carries `continuesFrom`, so it is a FOLLOW-UP TURN.
 *
 * Which id the app uses for a conversation depends on when you ask. A live
 * run does not always know its earlier turns, so its row is keyed by the turn
 * itself; once the ledger is re-read the same conversation is keyed by its
 * ROOT. So a name typed — or a group chosen — during the live turn was stored
 * against that turn's id and then looked for under the root's, where nothing
 * was. The name fell back to the derived title and the membership became
 * invisible.
 *
 * Writing still uses the root when it is known, because that is the stable
 * identity. Reading tolerates whichever id was current when the person acted.
