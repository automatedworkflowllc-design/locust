/**
 * A runtime cannot claim a mode by saying nothing.
 *
 * `modeRunsOn` was a chain of `if` clauses ending in `return true`, each
 * clause a war story worth keeping — and the fall-through was the defect.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-09-21, by accident, while adding Muse: putting `muse` into
 * `MissionRuntimeId` made the app offer **Ask, Accept edits, Auto and Plan**
 * on a runtime with no adapter, no command builder and no event normalizer.
 * Nothing asked; silence meant yes.
 *
 * (A correction worth recording: I first reported that adding the runtime
 * "broke nothing — typecheck clean, 3,689 green". That was a stale package
 * build. Rebuilt, the compiler named two exhaustive records it had to be
 * added to. The tooling was better than my account of it.)
 *
 * The first test below is the CONTROL. This commit is a refactor, so every
 * runtime that existed before must answer exactly as it did before, on both
 * platforms, for all five modes — the table was transcribed from the `if`
 * chain and a transcription error would be silent and awful.
