 * 0.711. Ling 3.0 answered "Upstream request failed: Model is unavailable."
 * for more than twelve hours over 2026-10-08/09. First of the free models
 * listed, it was still what "Use a free model" started on, what Compare put
 * beside a free model (the 0.710 and 0.711 drives of compare-keep-carries-on
 * both failed on a B column that never answered), and what a card offered
 * after another free model failed. A free model that just said so is passed
 * over wherever Locust suggests one, for six hours or until it answers.
