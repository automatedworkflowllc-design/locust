/**
 * Slash commands: a way in to what the composer can already do.
 *
 * Deliberately not a new capability. Every command here maps to a control that
 * is already on the composer row -- the mode menu, the route picker, the
 * effort chip, the swarm mark, the stop button -- so the first version adds a
 * keyboard path to things that exist and demonstrably work, and nothing that
 * has to be built underneath it.
 *
 * That is the rule this app keeps returning to: a control drawn for a
 * capability that does not exist costs more than a missing one. The `+` was
 * removed for a year of design-review time over exactly this. So there is no
 * `/attach` until attaching has a keyboard path worth naming, no `/memory`,
 * and no `/agents`.
 *
 * The menu is built from what the CALLER says is available -- a command whose
 * mode this runtime cannot honour, or `/stop` when nothing is running, is not
 * offered. `availableCommands` is where that filtering happens, so a command
 * can never be listed and then refused.
