/**
 * What hovering a teammate tells you.
 *
 * Colin, 2026-09-07: "make sure that if we hover over the teammates we can see
 * their role and name" -- "and the model they are using". The tooltip said
 * only "Message Wren", which is the least interesting of the four facts, and
 * in the compact avatar rail it was the ONLY one available: the name, role and
 * route are all drawn as text, and the rail hides text.
 *
 * So a rail avatar was a coloured square with no way to find out whose it was
 * without widening the window.
 *
 * Order is name, role, route -- what identifies them, then what they do, then
 * what they run on. A teammate that has never run has no route, and the line
 * simply ends: a tooltip claiming a model that nothing has resolved yet would
 * be inventing the one fact people open this app to compare.
