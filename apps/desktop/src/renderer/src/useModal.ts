/**
 * What a modal dialog owes the keyboard, in one place.
 *
 * The beta review of 0.255.0 (#1) tabbed through the routine editor: after
 * Save changes, focus went to the window's Minimize, Maximize and Close,
 * then Home, Add and the conversation search behind the scrim -- and Escape
 * left the dialog open, even with focus in its own name field. The teammate
 * and group dialogs caught Escape only while focus happened to be inside.
 *
 * So every dialog gets the same four things:
 *   - focus moves INTO it when it opens (unless something inside already has it)
 *   - Tab and Shift+Tab cycle inside it and never reach the page behind
 *   - Escape closes it, wherever focus is
 *   - focus goes back to whatever opened it, once it is gone
