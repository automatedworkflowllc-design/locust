/**
 * The wall a person hits after doing exactly what the app told them to.
 *
 * From the independent QA pass on 0.36.5 (2026-09-06), reproduced live on
 * Linux: install nothing, read Settings, run `npm install -g opencode-ai`,
 * come back to the window -- discovery finds it, the Settings row goes READY,
 * home says "1 runtime connected" -- then type a message and press Enter.
 * Nothing happens. The box still says "Install a coding agent and sign in to
 * start a mission…", and no part of the screen says why.
 *
 * The cause is not the placeholder alone. `App.tsx` seeds the route as
 * `codex/account-default` and never moves it, and the composer decides
 * everything from THAT route's runtime rather than from whether any runtime
 * on the machine can run at all.
 *
 * Rendered rather than unit-tested because the placeholder is the whole
 * finding: it is the sentence the person reads. There is no DOM environment
 * in this repo, so this renders to static markup and asserts on the string a
 * person would see. The "Enter does nothing" half is proven by a drive, not
 * here -- no click is simulated.
