/**
 * The composer's sentence about hung coding agents, counted.
 *
 * Grok, pass 16, the extra finding: the box read *"A coding agent is installed
 * but not answering"* over FIVE rows that each said so and each carried their
 * own Check again. The list was plural, the buttons were plural, and the box
 * you type into was not.
 *
 * Fixed in 0.201.0, and the plan then said to **re-verify it on Grok's next
 * pass** rather than trust my own count. That was the wrong instrument. A
 * tester noticing again is not a guarantee, it is a coincidence with good
 * habits -- and the sentence is a pure function of props, so it can be pinned
 * here and stay pinned. This is that.
 *
 * THE SECOND CLAIM IS THE HARDER ONE: the count is only the runtimes this
 * sentence is ABOUT -- installed, and still not usable after discovery gave
 * up. A machine with one working CLI and one hung one is not "2 coding agents
 * are not answering", and an off-by-one in the *other* direction would be a
 * sentence that overstates how broken the machine is, on the screen of
 * somebody deciding whether this app works at all.
