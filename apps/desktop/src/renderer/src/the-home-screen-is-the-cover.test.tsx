/**
 * THE HOME SCREEN IS THE DESIGN SYSTEM'S COVER.
 *
 * Colin, 2026-09-22, of 0.270's home screen, which had the cover's lockup and
 * nothing else: "it can be a 1:1 once you fix the text description under
 * locust tbh ... cause right now it just looks like the locust logo and crt
 * shipped". So the card carries the whole cover -- lockup, the claim under
 * it, and the three teammates -- drawn to the column's width.
 *
 * AS A MACHINE (A2, 0.295). Colin: "the teammates could have a structure to
 * be on top of, the border, crt effect, would almost make it look like a
 * machine", then of the sample: "make the screen bigger and put the text in
 * it as well". The boot screen's bezel and glass, centred; the lockup and the
 * claim on the glass; the three standing on the bezel.
