/**
 * CODEX BUDDY, DRAWN BY LOCUST BELOW HIS HEAD (2026-10-05).
 *
 * Colin, of the rig's first body -- his maker's drawing with its arms cut
 * off: *"his arms look broken when hes shoulder pressing, some real freaky
 * stuff ... maybe make him a little bit buffer"*, and *"the bottom half looks
 * a little cooked / trimmed in ms paint-ish"*. A drawing with its arms cut
 * out keeps its sleeves where the arms were and its legs where they stood.
 * So only his head is his maker's (`buddyHead`: his cap, his hair, his ears;
 * his screen covers his face), and all of him below it is drawn here, in his
 * maker's style -- his ink round flat colour, a shaded side, chunky shapes:
 *
 * - his shirt and its sleeves as ONE shape (inked, then filled), so a sleeve
 *   turns with its arm and meets his shirt with no seam;
 * - his arms built of rounded pieces -- a shoulder, a biceps that swells as
 *   the elbow bends, a forearm thick at the elbow and narrowing to the wrist
 *   -- each arm inked whole and then filled, so its elbow has no seam;
 * - his star shorts following his thighs, his shins and his shoes, his knees
 *   bending as he squats with his shoes where they stand.
 *
 * His arms are drawn over his shirt, never over his shoulders: each turns
 * inside its sleeve, and the sleeve is laid over it again.
