/**
 * "WREN FINISHED" -- WHEN A FINISH IS WORTH HEARING ABOUT (0.379).
 *
 * attention.ts never toasted a finished run, on purpose: "a notification
 * for every finished run would train a person to dismiss the one that
 * matters." Orca notifies on every done (read 2026-09-26), and softens it
 * with cooldowns. This keeps the rule's point and answers the case it left
 * out -- a person who set a teammate on a long job and went to another app:
 *
 * - only a run the person started here (not a room member, whose room
 *   gathers its own toasts, nor a relay, a routine, or a run restored from
 *   the record);
 * - only one that took at least a minute -- a reply you were watching
 *   arrive needs no toast;
 * - finished or failed, never stopped: whoever pressed Stop knows;
 * - and only when the window is elsewhere, which the host decides.
