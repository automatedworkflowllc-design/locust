/**
 * A switched-off Install button says why on the screen, not on hover.
 *
 * Reported by the first outside tester on 0.55.0, in their own words: "it
 * shows up as either get it or install but they do nothing", and "one of
 * them is highlighted green but still no difference". They also said, in the
 * same breath, "it automatically connected with codex" — which is the whole
 * bug.
 *
 * Four of the five runtimes install through npm, so with no Node.js on the
 * machine every Install button is correctly disabled. The sentence saying so
 * was gated on `connected === 0`. Codex signs itself in on many machines, so
 * the moment it was found the count stopped being zero, the explanation
 * disappeared, and the reason survived only in a `title` tooltip. What is
 * left is a panel of buttons that do nothing, with nothing on screen to say
 * why — which is exactly what was described.
 *
 * The green one is the free runtime's primary Install button, disabled like
 * all the others and looking the most pressable of the lot.
