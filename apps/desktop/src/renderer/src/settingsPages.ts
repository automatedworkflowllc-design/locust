/**
 * Settings as PAGES, not one scroll.
 *
 * Colin asked for this twice. The first time (2026-09-14) the answer was to
 * group thirteen subjects into five named areas, still in one column, and he
 * said again on 2026-09-17: "our settings is a literal disaster". It was: the
 * areas were right and you still had to scroll past four of them to reach the
 * fifth, and nothing told you the fifth existed.
 *
 * So the areas become pages with a list beside them, which is the shape
 * Claude Code uses and the one he pointed at. Nothing about the settings
 * themselves changes -- same sections, same order, same words behind `More`.
 * What changes is that you can see the whole map at once and land on any of
 * it in one press.
 *
 * The headings are listed here so the search can find a setting by its own
 * name rather than only by the page it lives on. `settings-pages-are-real`
 * holds this list to the headings the file actually renders, because an index
 * that drifts is worse than no index: it would quietly stop finding things.
 *
 * `alsoKnownAs` is the OTHER half, and it exists because an index of headings
 * only finds the words WE chose. Grok's pass 9 typed four words a person who
 * had just used the app would type -- memory, worktree, node, ledger -- and
 * every one was answered "Nothing matches. The pages are still here". All
 * four settings exist. Memory is under "What your team remembers"; worktrees
 * are under "Project folder"; the ledger is a definition on "Privacy & local
 * data". Being told a thing does not exist is worse than having to scroll for
 * it, because a person stops looking.
 *
 * Each word is filed UNDER THE HEADING IT LEADS TO, so a search for a word
 * that is nowhere on the screen can still answer with the place it lives:
 * type "memory", get "What your team remembers". A flat list of page-level
 * words would find the page and leave the person to hunt it.
 *
 * These are deliberately not headings. Renaming "What your team remembers" to
 * "Memory" would make the screen read like a search index, and the heading is
 * the better sentence. The two lists are kept apart so the drift guard goes
 * on meaning exactly what it means.
 */
/*
 * ELEVEN PAGES IN FIVE GROUPS, each with an icon (0.393).
 *
 * Colin, 2026-09-27, with a screenshot of Claude's own settings: "we should
 * just make our settings like claude codes, way cleaner and more organized
 * than ours and has icons". Claude files each subject on a page of its own
 * under a small group label, with an icon beside every name. Five pages that
 * each held two to four unrelated subjects became eleven that each hold what
 * their name says; the sections themselves are unchanged.
