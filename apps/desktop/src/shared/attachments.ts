/**
 * Files a person attached to a message, said in a way every runtime can act on.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-08 (`docs/ATTACHMENTS-INTAKE-2026-09-08.md`): of the six
 * runtimes, three take a file natively (`opencode -f`, `copilot
 * --attachment`, `codex -i` for images) and three take nothing at all. What
 * ALL six can do is read a file inside the workspace, because that is what
 * they are for.
 *
 * So the first version attaches by REFERENCE: the message names the paths and
 * asks the runtime to read them. That is not a stand-in for the real thing --
 * the file genuinely reaches the model, by the runtime's own read, and the
 * read then appears as a tool row in the activity fold. The app can show that
 * it happened instead of claiming it did.
 *
 * Two rules this module exists to keep:
 *
 *   NEVER INLINE THE CONTENTS. A 40 KB paste would eat the prompt budget that
 *   inbound peer messages already lose to (`composeRuntimePrompt` drops a
 *   waiting message when the prompt runs long, measured in its own tests).
 *   A path costs a line.
 *
 *   NEVER CLAIM MORE THAN HAPPENED. The line says "read these files", because
 *   that is what was asked. When step B hands the three capable runtimes the
 *   file natively, the wording for those changes to match.
