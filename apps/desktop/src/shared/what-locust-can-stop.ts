/**
 * WHAT LOCUST CAN STOP, AI agent by AI agent (0.617; the PRD's R9 and A1).
 *
 * Locust does not run an agent's tools; each AI agent runs its own, and
 * Locust can stop one only where that agent asks first. Where it asks, a card
 * waits for the person, their saved rules answer before it reaches them, and
 * the record says who decided (shared/who-decides.ts). Where it does not ask,
 * the mode decides what the agent is given, and nothing is stopped one action
 * at a time. A buyer reading the public copy, and a person choosing a mode,
 * should both be told which is which -- in the same words.
 *
 * So this is the one source: Settings > AI agents draws it, and
 * docs/WHAT-LOCUST-CAN-STOP.md is written from it (the test fails when the
 * file and this disagree). Each line was read off the code that builds the
 * run -- packages/runtime-adapters/src/commands.ts, the approval paths in
 * main/ -- and the modes off RUNTIME_CAPABILITIES; the test holds the reach
 * of each to those facts. Plan runs wherever Ask does, and reads like it.
 * Gemini is left out: no run can start on it.
