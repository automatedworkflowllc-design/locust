 * Team memory: what every teammate remembers, shared across the team and

 *
 * Colin's call (2026-09-05): the shared memory Claude Code and Cursor have,
 * managed from the app. Both of those keep memory PER PROJECT and put a
 * hand-written global file beside it; Cursor asks before it keeps a memory,
 * Claude Code keeps it and says so. Locust does the same shape: a memory
 * belongs to a folder unless the teammate says "everywhere", every teammate
 * in that folder reads it, the person picks "keep on its own" or "ask me
 * first" in Settings, and the Memory screen lists every one with who wrote
 * it, where, and from which conversation -- editable, switchable, deletable.
 *
 * A teammate writes memory the way it moves a task board: by ending its
 * reply with one block, one line per memory.
 *
 *   <locust-memory>
 *   remember :: This project's tests run with pnpm test, never npm.
 *   remember everywhere :: Colin wants diffs, not prose.
 *   forget :: The API is on port 3000
 *   </locust-memory>
 *
 * Memories are matched by their text, case- and punctuation-blind, so a
 * `forget` that quotes the memory hits it. Unknown verbs and empty lines
 * are dropped; a bad line never refuses the block.
