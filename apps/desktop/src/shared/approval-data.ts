/**
 * What would leave this machine, said only where it can be known.
 *
 * The approval card answers what would happen, where, and whether it can be
 * undone. It never said what DATA the action sends — which the design pass
 * names as the row it is missing, and which is the one question a person
 * cannot work out for themselves. A file write they can reason about; whether
 * a shell command phones somewhere they cannot, because the command may be a
 * script whose contents are not on screen.
 *
 * So the rule here is asymmetric, deliberately:
 *
 *   - A file change sends NOTHING, and that is provable. The bytes are written
 *     to a path on this disk. Say so plainly.
 *   - A command that names a network tool CAN reach the network. Say that it
 *     can, and say that Locust cannot see what it would send — because it
 *     cannot.
 *   - Any other command is UNKNOWN. Never say "nothing leaves this machine"
 *     about a command, however harmless it looks: `./deploy.sh` is two words
 *     and can do anything.
 *
 * The dangerous direction is the false negative — telling someone nothing is
 * sent when something is. So the negative is only ever claimed for the one
 * kind where it is a fact, and the positive is a capability ("can reach"),
 * never a prediction ("will send").

/**
 * Programs that reach the network as their ordinary purpose. Matched as whole
 * words so `curling` and a file called `wget-notes.md` do not trip it.
 *
 * Under-matching here is safe by construction: an unmatched command falls to
 * "Locust cannot tell", which is the honest answer anyway. Over-matching would
 * be noise, not danger.
