/**
 * WHO TAKES EACH STEP OF A CHAIN TEMPLATE (2026-10-05).
 *
 * A chain template names a ROLE for each step ("Research & Briefs", "Code &
 * Migrations", "Docs & QA"), because a template cannot know anyone's roster.
 * When a person starts one, this proposes a teammate for each role from the
 * roster they have. It is only a proposal: the editor shows it, step by step,
 * and the person changes any of it before the routine is saved.
 *
 * - A role with a teammate on the roster goes to that teammate (the first one,
 *   in roster order). A checker prefers a teammate who has not taken an earlier
 *   step, so the work is not checked by whoever did it, when there is another.
 * - A role nobody on the roster has goes to whoever took the step before it, so
 *   a roster of one -- or of teammates with other jobs -- still works: the
 *   steps go to them. A checker with no match goes to someone who has not
 *   taken a step yet, if there is such a teammate.
 * - An empty roster proposes nobody.
