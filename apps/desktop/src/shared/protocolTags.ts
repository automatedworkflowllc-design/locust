/**
 * Every tag this app parses out of a reply, and the one rule for text that
 * did not come from the person.
 *
 * Locust reads five protocol blocks out of what a teammate says, and each one
 * makes the host DO something: `locust-share` sends a message as that
 * teammate, `locust-memory` writes to the team's memory, `locust-ask` puts a
 * decision in front of Colin, `locust-task` moves a room's board, and
 * `locust-file` hands the person a file the teammate wrote.
 *
 * Model-authored text gets re-injected into other prompts all over this app --
 * a peer message quoted into the recipient's briefing, a reviewed turn quoted
 * into the reviewer's, a relayed answer handed to the next teammate. Any of
 * those quotes can carry a block, and a model asked to review or reply to
 * quoted text very often reproduces it verbatim. The block then arrives in the
 * SECOND teammate's reply, where the host parses it and acts -- under the
 * second teammate's name, with nobody having asked for it.
 *
 * `peer-share.ts` has defended exactly this since peer messages existed, and
 * its comment says why. What it did not do was cover the other three tags, or
 * the places other than a peer message where model text is quoted. Found
 * 2026-09-13 reading xai-org/grok-build, whose harness tags every input with
 * an `InputAuthority` -- `HumanIntent`, `ModelAuthoredUntrusted`,
 * `RuntimeControl` -- and lets what an input is ALLOWED to do follow from
 * that. This is the small honest version of the same idea: one rule, in one
 * place, for text that is not the person's.
 *
 * Defanged rather than deleted. The reader still needs to see what was said --
 * that IS the point of quoting it -- so the angle bracket becomes a visibly
 * different character and the words survive intact.

 *
 * `LOOSE_TAG` requires a closing bracket and a whole tag name, because that is
 * what makes it safe to delete anything at all. An interrupted turn produces
 * neither: the stream stops mid-word, so what reaches the person is the first
 * few characters of a tag and nothing else. Every complete tag on the message
 * came off and this one stayed, which reads as the teammate having typed it.
 *
 * NARROW ON PURPOSE, three ways. It matches only at the END of the text,
 * because that is the only place a cut-off stream can leave one; only a
 * PREFIX of a tag this app actually knows; and only from four characters in
 * (`<locu`, `</locu`), so a lone `<` or a truncated `</li` from some other
 * language is left exactly where it is.
 *
 * `[a-z-]*` after the prefix, not `.*`: the partial cannot contain a space or
 * a bracket, or it is not a cut-off tag name -- it is prose with a bracket in
 * it, and prose is the thing this function exists to protect.

/**
 * The last thing done to a reply before a person reads it: take the tags off
 * anything still wearing them.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Each of the five parsers is strict, and each has a matching
 * stripper built from the SAME strict pattern -- so a block the parser will
 * not act on is also a block the stripper will not hide. Those two facts
 * multiply into the worst possible pair: the message goes nowhere AND the
 * person is shown the plumbing.
 *
 * Colin, 2026-09-20, with a photograph of a bubble reading
 * `<locust-share>Booty :: Reply with exactly the word PEBBLE-6725...`: "bug i
 * think". A bare open tag -- no `to=` -- which `parseShareBlocks` drops and
 * the share stripper's `\s+` never matched. The same hole is in the other
 * four from the opposite side: they accept no attributes at all, so
 * `<locust-memory scope="team">` leaks exactly as loudly.
 *
 * UNWRAP, DO NOT DELETE. The strippers delete because their block was ACTED
 * ON -- it is already a peer card, a memory entry, a decision. Nothing acted
 * on this one, so its body is the only copy of what the teammate said, and
 * deleting it would trade a visible defect for a silent one. The tags come
 * off; the words stay, as ordinary prose the person can read and forward.
 *
 * Unpaired tags are handled by not caring about pairs. A turn cut off
 * mid-block leaves an open tag with no close, which is the case a
 * block-shaped pattern gets wrong and this gets right for free.
 *
 * CODE IS LEFT ALONE. A teammate reading this repo from inside Locust and
 * explaining the protocol writes these tags ON PURPOSE, in a fence, and that
 * is not plumbing -- it is the answer. It happens here often enough to be in
 * these comments twice already.
