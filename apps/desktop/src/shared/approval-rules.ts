/**
 * SAVED APPROVAL RULES (0.521), the evaluator. Product ideas (Bloks note,
 * item 1): an approval card's "Always" becomes a rule a person can see as a
 * sentence and remove, scoped to a teammate and a folder. Copied from Claude
 * Code's own permission rules where they fit: `Bash(npm run test:*)` is a
 * command prefix, `Edit(src/**)` a path pattern, and deny always wins.
 *
 * This file only DECIDES; nothing here runs, writes or answers a card. It is
 * a security surface, so its rules are narrow on purpose:
 *
 *   - Deny is checked first and wins over any allow.
 *   - An allow on a command covers ONE simple command: never one carrying
 *     `;` `&&` `||` `|` `&` `$(` a backtick, a redirect or a newline. Such a
 *     command still asks, whatever the rules say. A deny, though, matches
 *     any simple part of a compound command -- `ls; rm -rf x` is denied by
 *     a rule denying `rm`.
 *   - A path rule matches only paths inside the folder the rule is scoped
 *     to, relative to it; `..`, another drive or an absolute path elsewhere
 *     is never allowed by a rule.
 *   - A question to the person is never governed: it always asks.
 *   - No rule, or anything this cannot read: ask.
