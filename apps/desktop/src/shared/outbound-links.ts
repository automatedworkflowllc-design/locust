/**
 * Every address this app is allowed to open in a browser, named here.
 *
 * The host denies `window.open` outright and cancels any navigation away
 * from the app's own URL, because `shell.openExternal` hands a URL to the
 * operating system where none of the packaged build's egress rules apply --
 * anything running in the renderer could otherwise have posted the mission
 * ledger to a host of its choosing, one browser launch at a time.
 *
 * The note beside that policy in `index.ts` said "Nothing in this shell
 * links out, so nothing is opened", and asked that a feature which needs a
 * link name the exact URL in the host. That stopped being true and nobody
 * did: the first-run panel grew `<a target="_blank">` links for the two
 * runtimes that are not npm packages, and one for Node.js itself. Every one
 * of them was dead, silently, in every build that shipped them -- reported
 * by the first outside tester on 0.55.0, who had no Node and whose only
 * offered way out was the link that did nothing.
 *
 * So: this list, checked in the host. The renderer asks for a URL and the
 * host opens it only if it is one of these exactly. A renderer that has been
 * turned against the person can reach these three addresses and nowhere
 * else, which is the same guarantee the deny-everything policy gave.
 *
 * The runtime addresses are read from `runtime-install.ts` rather than
 * copied, so a vendor URL that changes there cannot leave a dead link here.

 * that -- the whole value of a link in a reply is that it goes somewhere
 * nobody anticipated.
 *
 * Colin asked for it twice, 2026-09-14: "do we have clickable links yet" and
 * "source links are hoverable but not clickable". The old answer was a
 * deliberate no, and the note explaining it said "what it asked for is what a
 * prompt injection would ask for". That was the right instinct about the wrong
 * risk. A reply is rendered as TEXT, never as markup, so a model cannot
 * execute anything here; what it can do is write a label that disagrees with
 * its target and hope for a click. The answer to that is not to break every
 * honest citation -- it is to show where the link actually goes, which is
 * what `linkHost` is for.
 *
 * Narrow on purpose:
 *   - http and https ONLY. No `file:`, no `vscode:`, no custom scheme -- the
 *     original worry was a reply becoming a way to reach the machine, and
 *     that worry survives intact.
 *   - It must parse as a URL with a real host.
 *   - The person still has to click it, and the browser it opens in is
 *     theirs, outside this app entirely.
