/**
 * A TEAM IN ONE CLICK.
 *
 * Paperclip's second idea worth taking (2026-09-26): a person who opens
 * Locust for the first time meets an empty Home and one button, and has to
 * invent a teammate -- a name, a role, a face -- before anything happens.
 * Locust is for "quite literally ANY ai user" (Colin): someone writing code,
 * someone watching their money, someone writing or designing. So Home offers
 * a team for each, ready to talk to; every one of them can be renamed,
 * re-faced, given another model or removed like any teammate.
 *
 * No model is chosen here. A template cannot know which of the person's
 * tools are signed in, so each teammate runs on the model the person picks,
 * exactly as a teammate made by hand does before its first run.
