/**
 * SINCE YOU WERE AWAY (0.590, the PRD's R17 / U4).
 *
 * Routines are what the buyer bought, and the morning-after view did not
 * exist: a run that finished, failed or was missed while nobody was at the
 * window was findable only by reading the sidebar row by row. This reduces
 * what the window already holds -- the conversation rows, the routines with
 * their misses, the set of turns waiting on the person -- to one list for
 * Home and one line for the tray: ran, failed, missed, waiting on you.
 *
 * `since` is the moment the person was last at the window (main/away.ts
 * keeps it). Pure, shared: the renderer reduces, the main process words the
 * tray line from the counts the renderer hands back.
